I had never worn shoes before.
When I saw children wearing
nice shoes, I would look at them
with longing.

Naali si nambalangaho ngayito
nayire.
Ninawonanga abaana
nibambaye ngambengomba


##
Maama galomanga ati ‘’oja
huba n’emigogo jinyi eyiwujaho
eyo,linda hyoka!’’
Sinefugiringa ebigandomanga..
Lulala namuwusaho ti
.’’eyiwujaho eyo nje aŋaali?’’


##
Ebiseera byabita nga
kusimamasi esemberera.
Abaatu abatiinanga mu katale
bagaluhanga na maboŋo ge
biitu ebinyaha.
Nga muwusa ti ‘’maama,hu
tiina mu katale?’’


##
Ku wuhye hu kurisimasi maama
gasisimusa mu mawiwi kitali
hyawulijo.
Gandoma pambe ogusero
ogubba ogohuguliramo ebiitu.


##
.
Mu katale mwalimo abasaye
bangi n’abaana bawe ni bagula
engoye epyaha n'emere.


##
We went straight to where there
were many different types of
shoes.
Hwaŋabirira hwatiina aŋabali ni
batunda engayito enjenjawulo
n’enjawulo.
Nasamiriye nahengera hiisi
lulayini olubali nibanyire aŋo.


##
After trying on many pairs, I
settled for black lace-up shoes.
At home that night, I couldn’t
sleep.
I was so excited thinking of how
I would wear my new shoes and
show off to every child in the
village.


##
After a while, I got out of bed
and put on the shoes.
I walked slowly around the room
and then put the shoes back
into
the box.
I lay down again, but I couldn’t
sleep.


##
I got up and tried on the shoes
a second time.
I strutted around the room for a
while and then put them back.


##
I lay down once more and tried
to sleep. But I got up a third
time.
I put on the shoes and jumped
around the room. Then I felt
tired.
I decided to get back into bed.


##
Nibuhyeye maama gasisimusa
,Gawuusa ati’’hyina hino
ehimbona?’’


##
Naali penyuhire ne engato ni jiri
mu magulu hu wuliri
