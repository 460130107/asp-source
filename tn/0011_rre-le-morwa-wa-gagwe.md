# Rre le morwa wa gagwe

##
Go ne go le monna a bidiwa Thabo.

##
There was a man called Thabo.

##
O ne a na le morwa. Ena o ne a bidiwa Thabong.

##
This man had a son. 

The son's name was Thabong. 

##
Ka letsatsi lengwe monna a re go morwaagwe," A re phuthulole maoto."

##
One day the man said to his son, “Let’s go for a walk.”

##
Fa ba ntse ba tsamaya, ba bona mokotla wa diaparo. O ne o tletse.

##
On the way, they saw a very nice suitcase. It was packed full.

##
Monna o ne a itumetse thata. "E tsholetse re ye gae ka yona," a rialo go Thabong.

##
The man got very excited.

He said to Thabong, “Pick it up and we will take it home.”

##
Morwa o ile a dira se rragwe a reng a se dire. Thabong o ile a rwala mokotla ka tlhogo mme ba ya gae. 

##
The son did what the father told him to do. Thabong put the suitcase on his head and carried it.

##
Mo tseleng go ya gae, noga e ile ya tswa mo mokotleng.

Ya wela mo maotong a ga Thabong!

##
On the way home, a snake slithered out of the suitcase.

It landed on Thabong’s feet! 

##
Thabo le Thabong ba ne ba tshogile thata. Thabong o ile a latlhela mokotla mo fatshe. Ba ile ba tshaba ka lebelo le le tshabegang.

##
Father and son were both very scared. Thabong dropped the suitcase. They ran away very fast!
