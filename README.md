# Source stories from the African Storybook Project in Markdown format

This repository makes available the source texts of stories from the [African Storybook Project](http://africanstorybook.org) in Markdown format.

Each folder in the repository represents a language, identified by its [ISO 639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) or [ISO 639-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3) code. Source translations into each language are stored in the appropriate folders.

All of these source texts have been extracted from the pdfs available on the [African Storybook Project](http://africanstorybook.org) website. The markdown files in this repo provide data for many other projects, for example the [ASP Image Bank Explorer](https://github.com/dohliam/imagebank-explorer) and [Global-ASP Translator](https://github.com/dohliam/gasp-translator), as well as making possible the creation of [bilingual storybooks](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B59ZADK9EsbsWkJFbFdDVUtVYkU) in many languages.

Corresponding images for the stories in this repository can be found in the [ASP Image Bank](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-imagebank).

## Format

The extracted source text of all stories has been provided here in Markdown format. See [here](https://github.com/global-asp/global-asp#source-format) for specific details about the format used.

A sequence of two hashes `##` on a separate line indicates a page break.

Editing of the story content has been kept to a minimum and for the most part the stories are presented as they are. Corrections other than obvious errors of orthography or traces of the conversion process should be directed to the African Storybook Project website directly. (An easy way to do this is to simply version the story in question and use the online tools provided to modify and edit the story.)

## Languages

The African Storybook Project currently provides stories in 62 different African languages. This repository attempts to provide the source text for all of these stories in machine- and human-readable Markdown format.
