# Our wonderful world

##
Once upon a time long ago, when
there were no people, God looked
down at the beautiful world he had
made.
He thought I must have someone to
look after my creation.

##
The lion roared, "I am the king of
the jungle, I can look after the
world."

##
The elephant trumpeted loudly, "My
Lord, you have made me so big and
majestic. Surely I am right for the
job."

##
The whale looked up at the sky and spouted a
fountain of water, "Do they know how to swim and
look after the fish, the reefs, the coral and millions of
tiny sea animals?"
"I can look after the oceans. I can also keep my head
above water and see what is going on on the land. I
am so LARGE, no one will dare to do anything
against your will."

##
The shark thought his sharp teeth
were all that were needed to do the
job.

##
The eagle laughed, "These animals
can only look after those on land,
while the whale and the shark can
only see the water animals. But I
fly, I see the sky, land and water. I
am the only one fit to be the keeper
of the world."

##
God listened carefully to the animals, to the fish and
the birds.
"I will create man," he said. The animals all
wondered, what was this thing called "man".
What colour, with feathers or fur, or scales?
Will he run like the lion? Swim like a fish?
Fly high like the eagle?

##
The sun had set and it was night. He wrapped
himself in the night sky, put the twinkle of stars into
the eyes and used the black clouds for hair. He also
put pieces of the moon in the nails and the shine of
far away stars in the teeth.
So the first man and woman were created with shiny
black skins like the night.

##
Soon the night faded and it was
morning.
God covered himself in the white
morning light, took the blue sky for
the eyes, the gold of the sun he
spun into hair, and before him stood
a man and woman with white skins,
blue eyes and golden hair.

##
Now the morning had turned into
afternoon. The sun was very bright,
so he pulled the yellow light, and
the deep black shadow of the
afternoon and made a man and
woman with yellow skins, black hair
and eyes that slanted to look into
the sun.

##
It was now evening, the sky had become dusky and a
few stars had also appeared in the sky.
God looked down and saw the beautiful rich brown of
the earth and the dusk of the sky for the skin. The
black colour of the night was for the hair and he used
the sparkle of stars for the eyes.
Before him stood a man and woman with brown
skins, black hair and eyes.

##
The animals all looked in wonder at
the strange creature who stood on
two legs, with naked skin, with no
fur or feathers or even scales.
The lion looked down his kingly
nose and roared, "I can outrun them
and with a swipe of my paw I can
kill them, sorry for saying so."

##
The zebra suggested, "Some stripes
would have improved their look."
The leopard said, "A few spots."
The elephant trumpeted, "Surely
grey would have been a better
colour?"

##
The shark looked at their teeth and smiled showing
his sharp teeth. "Ah! No fins, how will they swim?
And they are going to be the keeper. Ha! Ha! Ha!"
The fish, big and small, laughed as they dived into
the deep water leaving a trail of bubbles of laughter.

##
God smiled kindly, "You see, to survive, man will
have to look after the animals, the oceans with all
their life, the plants, from the tiniest to the largest
trees."
"The day he starts destroying the world with his
greed, he will be destroyed."
The animals, the fish and the birds bowed their
heads and hoped they would be safe.
So let us, YOU and I, look after this wonderful world.
