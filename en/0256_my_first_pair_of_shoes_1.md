# My first pair of shoes

##
I had never worn shoes before.
When I saw children wearing
nice shoes, I would look at them
with longing.

##
My mother would say, “You will
have many pairs in the future,
just wait!”
Sometimes I did not believe her.
“When is the future?” I asked
her one day.

##
Time passed and it was nearly
Christmas.
Everybody was busy going to
the market and coming back
with bags of new things.
“Mother, are we going to the
market?” I asked her.

##
The day before Christmas, my
mother woke me up earlier than
usual.
She asked me to fetch
the big shopping basket she
always carried to the market.

##
At the open-air market there
were many parents with their
children.
They were buying new clothes
and stocking up on food.

##
We went straight to where there
were many different types of
shoes.
My eyes were wide with
amazement. I gaped at row
after row of neatly arranged
shoes.

##
After trying on many pairs, I
settled for black lace-up shoes.
At home that night, I couldn't
sleep.
I was so excited thinking of how
I would wear my new shoes and
show off to every child in the
village.

##
After a while, I got out of bed
and put on the shoes.
I walked slowly around the room
and then put the shoes back
into
the box.
I lay down again, but I couldn't
sleep.

##
I got up and tried on the shoes
a second time.
I strutted around the room for a
while and then put them back.

##
I lay down once more and tried
to sleep. But I got up a third
time.
I put on the shoes and jumped
around the room. Then I felt
tired.
I decided to get back into bed.

##
The following morning, I was
woken by my mother. “What is
this I see?” she asked.

##
I was wearing my new shoes in
bed!
