# Rooster and Hare

##
Once upon a time, there was a
rooster and a hare.
They were very good friends.

##
One night, Hare visited Rooster
and his family at home.
They enjoyed supper together.

##
Then came the time to go to
bed.
Hare saw that as Rooster and
his family slept, their heads
were hidden.

##
Hare saw that Rooster and his
family slept very well.
He was not able to sleep the
whole night.

##
In the morning, Hare wanted to
know Rooster's secret.
“Where do you put your heads
at night?” he asked.

##
Rooster decided to play a joke
on Hare.
He said, “My friend, we birds
have a secret for going to sleep.
At bedtime, we chop off our
heads. Without heads, we sleep
very well.”

##
“Then in the morning, we put
our heads back on,” explained
Rooster.

##
Hare went home and told his
family the secret of the
chickens.
The Hare family decided to try it
themselves!

What do you think happened?
