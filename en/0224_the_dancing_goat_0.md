# The Dancing Goat

##
One day, a goat went out in the bush, and wandered around
happily. But then she got lost!

##
Suddenly, she met a wolf! The wolf came up to her, and he
looked very hungry.

##
The goat said: Mr. Wolf, I know you want to eat me. But I
would like to die happy!

##
The wolf asked the
goat: What do you
mean? Die happy?
How?

##
The goat answered: If I
have to die, I would like
to die dancing!

##
Then the wolf took his
guitar. He sat down and
started playing it.

##
And the goat started
dancing, though she
was still a little bit
worried.

##
Near that place, there were dogs. They came to see what
was happening.

##
Now that wolf was afraid of dogs. So he turned and ran
away!

##
And the goat kept on
dancing, because now
she was free from the
wolf!
