# A naughty girl

##
once upon a time the was a girl
by the name of Emily
Emily was very naughty

##
whenever her mother asked her
to do anything she would refuse

##
One day her mother was sick.
She asked her to go her
grandma and ask for some
special medicine, so that she
can drink and get better.
Because Emily was naughty,
she decided to go and have a
swim on her way to grand ma.

##
It became late, her mother started to worry.

##
Her mother called the people of the village to help her look for Emily

##
She was very worried because
there was a monster who eats
little girls at night

##
While the people were looking
for Emily, she was still having
fun in the pond.
She was not aware of the
darkness

##
It was time for dinner for the
monster and he started looking
for food. As he was walking he
started to smell a little girl.
The village people were getting
closer and closer to the pond.

##
Emily saw the monster coming
and she started to scream.
The people of the village heard
a little girl's scream and they
started to run towards the voice

##
The people of the village found
emily still in the pond, she was
very scared.
And from that day she learned
to listen and to respect her
mother.
