# Inyang and the Bird

##
Inyang was a herd's boy.

##
One day...

##
...he was very
hungry

##
He got a bird...

##
...and sent it home.

##
The bird flew...

##
...and landed on the hut.

##
People heard the bird.

##
Food was cooked.

##
They took food...

##
... found him under the tree.

##
The cows had gone.

##
They fed him.

##
His father went for the cows.

##
Inyang ate enough.

##
Inyang and the cows were taken home.

##
The bird had saved Inyang!!
