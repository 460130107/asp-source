# Day we saw the rainbow

##
My name is Kobole.

I live in a small village.

##
I was out picking fruits when I saw something I had never seen before.

##
There were colourful lines in the sky.

##
I dropped all the fruit and ran to tell people at home.

##
People were standing outside surprised.

##
I said happily, “It is a beautiful sheet hanging from the sky.” “No! I think someone is pouring paint from the sky.” Neno said.

##
Some people agreed with me. Others thought Neno was right.

We began to argue.

##
A man from a faraway village said, “You are all wrong.”

##
We shouted, “Tell us what it is if we are wrong.”

##
The stranger said, “It is the rainbow.

Have you never seen the rainbow before?”

##
We asked the stranger, “What is a r-a-i-n-b-o-w?”

##
Neno asked, “Is it ours? Can we keep it here?”

We never got answers to our questions because the man had left.
