# Huts in our village

##
A hut is made using poles, grass
and mud.

##
A hut has got one door and two
windows.

##
Huts are very good to stay in
during dry seasons because they
are cool.

##
Huts are also good to stay in When
it is raining because you do not
hear noise like on iron sheets.

##
Huts are very easy to make .

##
Every village in Uganda has got
huts.

##
BUT our village Nandahabi has got
the most beautiful huts.
