# Musau saves his father

##
Once upon a time, there was a
small boy named Musau who lived
with his father Syonzola.

##
Syonzola stayed out drinking until
very late every night and Musau
hardly ever saw him.

##
When Musau's father came
home, he would scream,
"Villagers, villagers! Come
and rescue me! I am being attacked
by a hyena."

##
On hearing Syonzola's
screams, the villagers would come
with their arrows and spears and
pangas, to rescue him.
But they would find that he was
drunk and just teasing them.

##
Musau's father continued
drinking and shouting for help late
at night. The villagers continued
going with arrows and spears and
pangas to rescue him. But each
time it was the same story. He
would only be teasing them.

##
Every time Musau's father
returned home late, Musau would
be woken by the screams for help.
Musau knew his father's
voice very well.
He would listen as Syonzola moved
in the dark until he reached the
door of their house.

##
One night, Syonzola came home
drunk as usual. But this time, a
hyena hid near the house.
When Syonzola screamed, the
hyena fiercely attacked him.

##
Syonzola screamed so loudly.
But the villagers said, "We are
tired of Syonzola's
tricks."
They turned over in their beds and
went back to sleep.

##
As usual, Syonzola's screams
woke up his son Musau.
Musau listened for his
father's steps as he always
did.
But his father did not seem to move
closer to the house. Musau sat up
and listened more keenly.

##
"My father is really in
danger," Musau said.
"This time he is not
teasing."

##
Musau jumped up from his bed.
He grabbed a smoldering log from
the fire and rushed out of the hut.

##
"Father, father," he
called.
In the moonlight, Musau saw
Syonzola struggling with an animal.
He raised the burning log.
When the hyena saw the fiery log,
he ran away.

##
After that, Syonzola never went out
again to drink.
Instead, he spent his days telling
interesting stories to the school
children.
