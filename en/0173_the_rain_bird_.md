# The Rain Bird

##
In a country called Gabon, a little
village stood at the very edge of a
forest. In the heart of this forest, in
the highest branches of an
enormous tree, lived a very special
bird − the bird that made rain.

##
For as far back as the villagers
could remember, they had taken
the time to keep this bird happy.
They saved scraps of bread, pieces
of fruit and fresh coconut milk, and
every week or two a group of
villagers took these delicacies into
the forest. When they had laid them
at the base of the tree, one of them
played a simple tune on the thumb
piano.

##
After a while, the bird flew down to
the ground to eat and drink. When
she had finished, she began to sing
the most beautiful song.
At the same time, she raised her
dark, shiny blue wings, and within
minutes, the rain began to fall.

##
This went on for many years.
Because the rain fell regularly, the
crops grew abundantly and there
was plenty of food in the village.
But gradually things began to
change. Somehow, the villagers
were always busy and they began
to neglect the rain bird. "It will rain
anyway," they said. "It's time to
stop spoiling that silly old bird!"

##
But the people were wrong. When
they stopped looking after the bird,
the rain stopped falling.
The crops began to dry up and die,
and the animals grew thin and
weak. Still, nobody in the village
went into the forest to feed the bird
that brought the rain. Now they
were all too busy trying to find
money to buy food in the
neighbouring town.

##
One scorching day, a young girl called Ketti decided to go into the
forest after school. "At least it will be cool in there," she thought to
herself. She walked and walked, and after some time, she came to
the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree.
Suddenly, she remembered how her granny had taken her into the
forest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened
her school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left over from her
lunch. Carefully she laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then,
because she had no thumb piano with her, she sang an old song
that she had known all her life.

##
With a loud whooshing sound, a
beautiful blue bird swooped out of
the branches above Ketti's head
and began to eat the bread. When
the bird had finished, she opened
her mouth and sang a few pure,
high notes.
Then she raised her shiny wings
and all of a sudden Ketti heard the
rumble of thunder. By the time she
reached her home, giant rain drops
were pelting down, cooling the
baking red earth.

##
Ketti was very happy, until she told her parents what had
happened. "Don't be silly!" scolded her mother. "Nobody believes
that bird has anything to do with the rain anymore!"
"Your mother is right," said Ketti's father. "The drought has been
broken now and we will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread
feeding that greedy old bird again!"
Though Ketti didn't argue with her parents, she felt sure they were
wrong. "If only Granny were still alive," she said to herself, "she
would have believed me!" But Ketti's granny had died a few years
earlier. The only thing Ketti had left, was her granny's old thumb
piano.

##
Two weeks passed and there was no
more rain. The crops began to
shrivel up again and the hungry
animals' ribs began to stick out
even more. The sun beat down
mercilessly from a glaring blue sky.
"I don't care what they say!"
thought Ketti. "We need rain. I'm
going to feed the bird again
tomorrow!"

##
So, early the next morning, after
taking a slice of bread and a
handful of red berries from the
kitchen, Ketti slipped out of the
house. She began to make her way
to the centre of the forest.
What she didn't realise, was that
her father was also awake. When he
saw what his daughter was doing,
he realised that she was going to
feed the rain bird again.

##
"I'll teach that disobedient child a lesson!" he said to himself
angrily. He snatched his bow and arrows and silently followed Ketti
into the forest.
Just as the bird flew down to eat the food that Ketti had set out for
it, her father raised his bow and released his deadly arrow. The
arrow flew straight into the bird's heart. The bird let out a piercing
shriek.
Terrified, Ketti spun around − just in time to see her father fall
down, stone dead. Ketti screamed and turned around − just in
time to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the bird's glossy body.
Then the bird, unharmed, swooped up into the highest branch of
the tree.

##
Ketti raced out of the forest to a
scene of utter devastation. Every
animal and every person she saw
lay dead on the ground. With a
pounding heart, she ran all the way
back to her home.
She quickly found her granny's old
thumb piano. "This is my only
hope!" she thought. "The rain bird is
angry. I have to make her happy
again! I HAVE to!"

##
Half an hour later, Ketti was back at
the base of the big tree. Her body
was drenched with sweat and she
was gasping for breath. A few paces
away from her lay the lifeless body
of her father.
Ketti looked away quickly, and with
trembling hands, began to play the
thumb piano.
She played and played, until her
fingers hurt.

##
Finally, what she wanted most in
the world happened. Down swooped
the bird as if nothing had happened.
The bird ate some of the berries still
lying on the ground and sang a few
notes. Then, as Ketti played on, the
bird raised her wings. Ketti heard a
rustle behind her.

##
It was her father who had woken
up.
"I'm sorry!" he said again and again
to the big, blue bird.
Then he held out his hand to his
daughter and they walked slowly
back to the village. In the village all
the people and animals were alive
again.

##
That night the villagers held a
meeting. They all agreed that they
had learned a valuable lesson. And
from that day onwards, not one
week passed without a special trip
to the forest to feed the bird that
brought the rain.
