# The tree that saved the village of Ombalantu

##
Thaimi lived in the village of
Ombalantu. One day she went with
her brother, Angula, to fetch water.
While Thaimi was filling her pot
Angula saw a hare. He ran after it.
He ran and ran and ran but the hare
was too quick for him.

##
Thaimi's pot was full and she was
ready to go home. She looked
around but she could not see
Angula. She walked and she walked
and she walked, looking for him. At
last she found him lying in the grass
behind a large anthill.

##
As she came closer Angula held his finger to his lips. Close by a group of strange men were
resting. The men had bows and arrows ... and spears!
"Angula," Thaimi whispered. "Those men are raiders. They have come to steal our cattle
and burn our village. Come quickly. We must run home and warn the village." So very
quietly and quickly Thaimi and Angula ran towards their village.

##
Near their village they met their
uncle. He was taking his cow to the
water. Thaimi called out, "Run,
uncle, run! Men are coming to steal
our cattle and burn our village.“
The man shouted at his cow and
made her run towards the village.

##
Further on Thaimi saw her aunt
working in the field and she called
out, "Run, aunt, run! Men are
coming to steal our cattle and burn
our village!"
The woman took her hoe, picked up
her sleeping baby and ran towards
the village.

##
Further on Thaimi saw her
grandfather. He was limping along
the road beside a donkey loaded
with grain.
And she called out, "Run,
grandfather, run! Men are coming
to steal our cattle and burn our
village!"
Her grandfather lifted his stick and
chased the donkey until it ran
towards the village.

##
When Thaimi and her brother
reached the village she called out to
everyone, "Run, run. Men are
coming to steal our cattle and burn
our village!"
The villagers were scared but they
did not know where to hide or what
to do.
Where could they hide their cattle?
Where could they hide their grain?
Where could they hide themselves?

##
Thaimi was very frightened but then
she remembered the place where
she and Angula sometimes went to
play.
A safe place.
A secret place.

##
She picked up a drum and began to
hit it as hard as she could.
Bam Bam Bam Boom Boom Boom
All the villagers stopped.
Thaimi called out, "I have a place to
hide. Follow me."
She took Angula by the arm.

##
Thaimi and Angula led the way to a
baobab tree which stood nearby.
"Why have you brought us here? We
cannot hide here," they said.
Thaimi said to her father, "Come. I'll
show you." They climbed into a
small opening at the top of the tree.
Thaimi and her father slid down into
the big trunk. It was huge and
hollow.

##
Thaimi and her father cut an
opening in the side of the tree. All
the villagers made their way
through the opening into the great
hollow inside the baobab tree.
Some villagers collected the grain
and the pots.
Others collected the goats, the
sheep and the cattle. And the
strange thing was that there was
room for everyone.

##
The sun went down.
The raiders crept up towards the
village. It was dark.
Inside the great tree the villagers
waited.
They were cold. They were hungry.
And they were afraid.
What was going to happen?

##
Then Thaimi said, "It's cold. Let's
make a fire.“
She took two stones and struck
them together. The sparks caught
the grass and small flames flared.
Soon a bright warm fire was
burning.

##
Light flamed from the tree. Fiery
eyes shone from the trunk. Bright
tongues licked the branches. Smoke
curled into the sky.

##
Outside the raiders saw the tree.
"It's a great spirit!" they cried in fear.
First one raider turned and ran.
Then another turned and ran.
Then another and another.
Until they had all run away.
The people of the village of Ombalantu were saved.

##
What do you think?
Was it Thaimi or the tree that saved
them all at Ombalantu?
