# Nanu's taxi

##
Hello! My name is Nanu. I am waiting with my mother for a
taxi. We are going home.

##
Here I am standing in line. My mother sings me a song.
“Come Mr Taxi can't you see? We are waiting, Nanu and me!”

##
The lady next to me is taking her chickens home. They will
lay eggs for her to eat.

##
These men are coming back from work. They smile at me. I
hear them sing, “Hey little Nanu, don't you worry. Taxi's
coming in a hurry.”

##
A lady walks past. She is a very smart lady. Aren't her shoes
beautiful? They go “click, click, click…click, click, click…”
when she walks.

##
This man is selling cold drinks. I love cold drinks. They are so
cold and sweet. Do you like them?

##
Look! There are ladies taking their supper home on their
heads. Aren't they clever?

##
That lady is having her hair done. She is going out with her
friends tonight.

##
I am tired now. My mother puts me on her back where I can
rest. She sings, “Please Mr Taxi, don't be late, Gogo is
waiting at our gate.”

##
There is my friend Tumi. He is also resting. We will be home
soon.

##
High up there the birds are flying home. They must get home
before it is dark.

##
This lady has beautiful earrings. I think she bought them in
town today. When I grow up I will buy many earrings for me
and my mother.

##
My mother is getting tired now. I sing her a song, “Please Mr
Taxi, won't you come, we are waiting, me and mum.”

##
Wait! I can hear the taxi! Here it comes!!!

##
This is our big red taxi. It has come to take me and my
mother home. I am very happy!

##
Goodbye!!!
