# Refiloe and the washed chickens

##
It was the first wedding in the
Tenane family, and Refiloe had
never been so excited in her life.
"I'm going to be Palesa's
bridesmaid, with a new dress and
shoes!" she said to her chickens.
Refiloe told her chickens everything.
Her father had given the chickens
to her as a birthday present, and
she loved them very much.

##
"Take those dirty scruffy chickens
out of here Refiloe!" shouted her
mother, "I don't want them
anywhere near this wedding tent."

##
Refiloe shooed her chickens out of
the tent.
"Run away you silly things." she
said, "I don't want you to be eaten
at Palesa's wedding!"

##
"Mme says that this is going to be the best wedding
ever seen in Malealea," Refiloe told her chickens,
"and she says that I can help all the older girls with
the cooking."
The chickens paid no attention to her.
"Refiloe!" called her mother from inside, "leave those
chickens of yours and come and help me with these
pots please!"

##
Refiloe's mother was very proud of her house, and wanted it to be
perfect for the wedding. She cleaned and washed and scrubbed
and scoured and polished everything in sight. When she had
finished, there was not a single speck of dust anywhere.
The chickens poked their heads inside the front door. "Out!"
shouted Refiloe's mother, "out you scruffy things with your dirty
feet and beaks!"

##
Refiloe followed her chickens out into the yard.
"Mme is right, you are a disgrace," she scolded them
So Refiloe thought for a while. Suddenly she smiled
and said to herself, "I have an excellent idea."
She went and filled a bucket with water from the
spring.
Refiloe had a lot of trouble catching her chickens.
They did not think that a bath was such a good idea.

##
Refiloe put the first chicken into the
bucket of water.
It clucked at the top of its voice and
flapped its wings like crazy.
"Hold still you silly thing," Refiloe
shouted, "this won't take long!"
When Refiloe wiped the chicken's
nose and eyes it suddenly went
limp and
flopped over the side of the bucket.

##
"This is no time to sleep," said
Refiloe. She gave it a good shake to
get all the water out.
"If you are not going to wake up
now, I'll have to put you somewhere
to dry nicely," she said. She laid the
chicken out on the grass to dry.
The chicken lay completely still.

##
Refiloe washed each and every one of her chickens.
Each and every one of them went limp and floppy
before she was finished with it.
She put all those eight chickens in a row on the grass
to dry.
Not one of them moved a single feather.
"I'll leave them to sleep a little," Refiloe thought to
herself, and off she went to check on the moroho.

##
Mme Ngwe and Mme Pedi were
Refiloe's aunts. They did not like
each other at all.
The aunts had been preparing for
months for Palesa's wedding, but
they would not even think about
riding together in the same taxi.

##
Mme Ngwe spotted Refiloe's chickens laid out to dry.
"What a nice little snack for me to take home!" she
said to herself.
She took off her chale and carefully wrapped all
those chickens up in it.
Not a single chicken moved.
"Perfect!" she smiled, "now I shall put them
somewhere where Mme Pedi will not ever find them,"
and she put the bundle around the corner among the
pumpkin vines.

##
Mme Pedi decided to make her famous pumpkin dish. She took her
big bowl and went off to the vegetable garden.
In the vegetable garden she saw Mme Ngwe's bundle under the
pumpkin vine. She undid the bundle.
Out fell all eight chickens. "Eish!" she cried jumping back in
surprise.
"Oh, you are the cleanest, prettiest chickens! Just ready for my
pot," she crooned.
"Now, where shall I hide you my darlings?" Mme Pedi chuckled, "I'll
have to find a very good place," she said walking round the house.
"I know," she said at last, "I'll put you on the roof!"
Mme Pedi climbed up onto the garden wall and put the chickens in
a row on the thatched roof.

##
The next day the sun rose in good time for the wedding. Refiloe
was up first and went to see her chickens.
She saw that they were no longer lying on the grass.
"They must be nicely dry by now. I'm sure they have gone to look
for their breakfast," she said.

##
Palesa's wedding was wonderful.
Those chickens did not get up off the roof to join in
when all the bridesmaid ladies danced into the yard.
Not one of the chickens stirred when the church choir
sang in their loudest, sweetest voices.
The chickens were still lying on the roof when the
priest gave his sermon.
They did not even twitch a feather when the pigs and
Refiloe's grandfather all snored loudly in the middle
of the sermon.
Not one foot of those chickens trembled when sheep
wandered into the tent, nearly knocking over the
wedding cake.

##
It was only when the groom's father
was halfway through his speech
that things started to change on
that roof.

##
The first chicken spread its wings and flew onto Mme Ngwe's
bosom. Mme Pedi next to her started giggling.
Another chicken flew up onto Mme Ngwe's new duku. The people
at the next table tried not to laugh.
The lady next to Mme Ngwe put her head down onto the table, "Ai,
aai, aaaaii, he, he, heeeeeeee!" she cackled.
All the other chickens decided to join the first two. You couldn't see
Mme Ngwe for all those chickens!

##
The guests screamed with laughter.
The men had to hold onto their bellies.
The women rolled around in their chairs.
The boys and girls were hanging onto each other.
The grandmothers could hardly breathe for laughing.
The grandfathers stamped their walking sticks.
Then the two aunts looked at each other and started giggling.
Mme Pedi opened her mouth wide with laughter. Mme Ngwe threw
back her head and laughed until all her chins shook.
Refiloe couldn't believe it!

##
All the guests agreed that it was the best wedding entertainment
ever known in Malealea.
"Oh you are so lucky!" Refiloe said to her chickens as she put them
into their coop for the night, "Mme says that she will never put you
in the supper pot."
"But look how dirty you are again," she told them, "I think I'll have
to give you another wash tomorrow!"
