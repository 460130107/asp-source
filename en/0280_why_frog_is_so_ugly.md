# Why Frog is So Ugly

##
Many years ago, the
Lizard and the Frog
were friends. One day
they decided to look
for girlfriends in the
city.

##
The Frog was jealous
of the Lizard's shining
and brilliant skin.

##
He said: What did you
do to look so beautiful?
Look at me,I am so ugly.
What can I do about my
skin?

##
The Lizard said:
Listen! Put some water
in a pot and put it on
the fire.
Next you...

##
But the Frog said: I
know already, I know.
Shut up, my friend. And
he left.

##
So he arrived home and
put some water in
a pot.

##
When the water began
to boil, he threw himself
into it.

##
and his skin was burnt
and his tail came off!

##
And instead of being
brilliant and beautiful
like the Lizard, he was
even more ugly!
