# Katitu Momambo, the clever little girl

##
Once upon a time there lived three
girls in a desert village in the
Kalahari. Katitu Momambo was the
youngest of the three. She was
small but clever and wise.
The three big girls went into the
veld one day to gather food and
wood. Little Katitu ran after them,
but the sisters sent her back. “Go
back Katitu! You are too small to go
with us! Stay at home!” they said.
Katitu did not pay attention to
them. She followed them from a
distance.

##
When they noticed her, they were
too far away from home to send her
back, so she joined them.
While she was walking behind
them, Katitu cut herself some wood.
She made herself a bow and many
arrows.
The girls walked and walked and
walked until the sun dropped into
the Kalahari horizon. They were
lost.
They walked into a deserted village
and found a hut in which to spend
the night.

##
An old woman was sitting next to
the hut.
Little Katitu went and greeted her.
“Oh?” answered the old woman,
“This is the village of the Big Snake!
He stays in a big hole in the cattle
kraal. When people come to milk
the cows, he eats them! He will go
to your hut at night when you sleep
and kill you there!”

##
Wise little Katitu did not panic. She asked the old woman for a
hard cow skin to cover the door of their sleeping hut. Then Katitu
wanted to sleep a little, so that she could stay awake throughout
the night. “When the wind begins to blow,” she said to her sisters,
“you must wake me up.”
The wind came up, the sisters awoke Katitu and went to sleep.
Katitu fixed the hard cow skin against the door of the hut and
made a little hole in the middle for her bow and arrows.
Katitu heard the Big Snake approach.

##
“Hai, gom-gom, hai, gom-gom,
where are they?” sang the Big
Snake.
The little clever girl answered him
with a chant, “Here they are, here
they are!”
Then the Big Snake rushed against
the hard skin at the door of the hut.
Little Katitu shot an arrow through
the hole in the skin.
Yes, the little girl killed the Big
Snake.

##
Then Katitu woke up the older girls.
“Sister, sister, sister,” she
whispered, “get up, get up, get up!”

##
And when the girls woke up they
saw a big snake lying there.
“Come, we have to take him back to
his hole!” shouted Katitu.
They rolled him up, rolled him up,
rolled him up and they set him right
back in his hole.
“Hurry! We have to run!” And the
girls ran and ran and ran.

##
The next morning, the Big Snake's wife told his children to go and
look for him. When his children found him lying dead in his hole,
they screamed: “Father is dead! Quick, let us go after those girls!”
All the snake's children went after the girls.
Katitu told her sisters to turn into trees. When the snakes arrived
at the spot where they had seen the girls, only trees were standing
there. The snakes were tired and lay under the trees to sleep.
When they were asleep, the girls turned back into human beings
and ran on.

##
The girls continued to run and were
very tired and thirsty. Eventually,
they saw a waterhole! None of older
sisters wanted to scoop the water
from the deep well. They asked
Katitu to climb in as she was the
smallest.
“Will you help me out of the well if I
climb into it?” asked Katitu.
“Yes,” they replied, “we will help
you.”
Katitu went into the well and
scooped water for her sisters.

##
Each girl drank and then walked
away. They all left Katitu in the deep
well and walked home.
Later that evening, the elephants
came to drink. One of them drank
and left. Another one drank and left.
The last elephant drank and
swallowed Katitu with the water!
A few drops of Katitu's blood
sprayed onto the reeds growing at
the water hole.

##
Meanwhile, Katitu's sisters had arrived home without any food or
wood. They were crying and told the family that Katitu was lost.
Everyone started searching for her.
Katitu's little brother and his friend were searching too. They
became very tired and rested next to a waterhole. They cut some
reeds to make themselves flutes. When Katitu's brother played on
his flute, the flute sang by itself:
“Is this my brother who plays me, who plays me,
The other girls left me, left me and the elephant swallowed me,
swallowed me!”
The boy rushed home and handed the reed to his father, who
played it. And again, the reed sang:
“Is this my father who plays me, plays me?
The other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swallowed me,
swallowed me!”
The father handed the reed to Katitu's mother, who played it. And
again, the reed sang:
“Is this my mother who plays me, plays me?
The other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swallowed me,
swallowed me!”

##
Katitu's father called the young
men of the homestead and ordered
them to find the tracks of the
elephants and find Katitu.
The young men hurried off. They
met the first group of elephants and
asked them, “Elephants, elephants,
have you seen the one who
swallowed our girl?”
And the elephants sang:
“!a plaf! !a plaf! We trot lightly. We
are so light, we carry nothing!”
And they passed on.

##
The young men met up with an old
elephant in the bush and asked,
“Old elephant, elephant, have you
seen the one who swallowed our
girl?”

##
The old elephant sang:
“!a plaf! !a plaf! I trot lightly! I am
so light, I carry nothing!”
But now the young men heard a
little voice in the belly of the
elephant.
“Cut him open! Go on, cut him on
his left side, for I am sitting on his
left side!” said the voice.

##
They held the old elephant down and cut open his belly. There was
little Katitu lying inside! The young men took her out and carried
her home. Katitu was welcomed as a hero by the villagers.
And that is the tale of Katitu Mamombo. The wise little girl who
saved her sisters from the Big Snake, saved them from the snake's
children, and (with the help of her brother) saved herself from the
belly of the elephant.
Of course, her sisters were punished.

Story notes
Ju|'hoan storyteller, Nxisae Magdaline Nxao, told a short version of
this story in Dkar, Botswana, in 2005 (Winberg 2009). In 1993,
Sigrid Schmidt recorded another version from Paulina Oxoros in
northern Namibia (Schmidt 2007: 59). This particular version was
retold by Marlene Winberg in 2013 for the Cave to Cave European
Union storytelling project in Spain, based on Nxao and Schmidt's
recording. The ‘clever little girl' belongs to a well-known story type
where a vulnerable young girl (or young boy), saves the lives of
others, by engaging her wit and the power of words, rather than
supernatural means to solve problems.
