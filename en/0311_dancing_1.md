# Dancing

##
I dance
happy,
I dance
I dance
lonely,
I dance


when I am
when I am sad,
when I am
when I am mad.

##
My teacher says,
“Sit still!
Don't dance about all
day.”

##
But my mother says,
“Dancing makes you
healthy,
Dancing makes you tall,
One day you'll be a
dancer,
And surprise them all!”

##
And I say,
“One day
I'll dance and people
will pay
Just to see me leap and
twirl.
‘Her dancing is SO
good,' they'll say.”
