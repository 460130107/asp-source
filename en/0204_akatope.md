# Akatope

##
Once upon a time there lived an
elderly woman who always
wanted a child.

##
The woman took the best clay soil she could find and
started to make a girl.

##
The girl who was made of mud
then turned into a real human
girl.

##
The elderly woman was very
happy.
She named the girl Akatope.
She loved Akatope very much.

##
Akatope was warned by her
elderly mother not to come out
of the hut but she would not
listen.
Whenever her mother was not
aware, Akatope would sneak
out to play with the other
children.

##
One day as Akatope was out
playing with the other children,
it began to rain hard.

##
The other children ran to their
huts but as Akatope ran to hers,
her legs started to dissolve.
She hunched over and sat down
between bushes.

##
The other children told their
parents what had happened to
Akatope.
They were very sad and
shocked.

##
When the elderly woman heard
what had happened to her only
child, she cried for many days.
The villagers who visited her,
decided to bring another little
girl who had been orphaned to
take the place of Akatope.

##
But that was not necessary.
A big surprise awaited the elderly woman!

##
Few days after the orphan girl
had been welcomed to the
elderly woman's home, there
was a gentle knock on the door.

##
"Who could that be," the elderly
woman wondered.
When she opened the door, she
could not contain her joy.

##
Akatope had come home.
But she was tired and sick.

##
Akatope's elderly mother sold
everything she owned.
She used the money to treat
Akatope.
Akatope grew up to be the most
beautiful girl in the village.
