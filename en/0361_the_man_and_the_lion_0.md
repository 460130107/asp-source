# The Man and the Lion

##
Once upon a time,
there was a man
walking in the bush.
Suddenly he met a
Lion!

##
The Lion was resting in
the short winter grass.

##
The meeting was so
sudden that the man
did not know what to
do.
He was full of fear.

##
At first, the Lion was
surprised too, and a
little afraid.
But there was a low
rumble in his stomach,
because he was hungry.

##
The man suddenly
found himself up a tall
tree.
He began to shout at
the Lion.

##
The Lion lay down
under the tree, waiting
for his meal.
As time went on, the
Lion fell asleep, or so it
seemed.

##
Soon the man fell
asleep.
Then he woke up again.
Finally he dozed off and
went fast asleep.

##
But then he crashed
down on the sleeping
Lion!

##
They both woke up
confused and
frightened.
The lion forgot his meal
and ran for his life.

##
The man began to run
in the same direction
as the Lion.
Then he realized that
he was running with the
Lion!

##
So he changed direction
and escaped being
eaten by the Lion!
