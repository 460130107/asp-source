# Anna and the three hairs

##
A long time ago, three girls went
out to collect wood.

##
It was a hot day so they went down
to the river to swim.
They played and splashed and
swam in the water.

##
Suddenly they realised that it was
late.
They hurried back to the village.

##
When they were nearly home,
Nozibele put her hand to her neck.
She had forgotten her necklace!
"Please come back with me!" she
begged her friends.
But her friends said it was too late.

##
So Anna went back to the river
alone.
She found her necklace and hurried
home.
But she got lost in the dark.

##
In the distance she saw light
coming from a hut.
She hurried towards it and knocked
at the door.

##
To her surprise, a dog opened the
door and said, "What do you want?"
"I'm lost and I need a place to
sleep," said Anna.
"Come in, or I'll bite you!" said the
dog.
So Anna went in.

##
Then the dog said, "Cook for me!"
"But I've never cooked for a dog
before," she answered.
"Cook, or I'll bite you!" said the dog.
So Anna cooked some food for the
dog.

##
Then the dog said, "Make the bed
for me!"
Anna answered, "I've never made a
bed for a dog."
"Make the bed, or I'll bite you!" the
dog said.
So Anna made the bed.

##
Every day she had to cook and
sweep and wash for the dog.
Then one day the dog said, "Anna,
today I have to visit some friends.
Sweep the house, cook the food and
wash my things before I come
back."

##
As soon as the dog had gone, Anna
took three hairs from her head.
She put one hair under the bed, one
behind the door, and one in the
fenced area in the village.
Then she ran home as fast as she
could.

##
When the dog came back, he looked
for Anna.
"Anna, where are you?" he shouted.
"I'm here, under the bed," said the
first hair.
"I'm here, behind the door," said the
second hair.
"I'm here, in the fenced area," said
the third hair.

##
Then the dog knew that Anna had
tricked him.
So he ran and ran all the way to the
village.
But Anna's brothers were waiting
there with big sticks.
The dog turned and ran away and
has never been seen since.
