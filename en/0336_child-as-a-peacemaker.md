# Child as a peacemaker

##
A woman carrying her baby went into the forest to pick fruit.

##
In the forest she found a tree with ripe fruit.

##
She put down her sleeping baby and climbed the tree.

##
An erotot from another community came by and saw the baby.

Surprised, he asked himself, "Where is the mother of the baby?"

##
As he bent down, the sound of the chains on his neck woke the baby.

##
He let the baby play with his chains. The baby laughed as he played.

##
The woman looked down to see why the baby was laughing. She saw a strange man close to her baby.

##
She was so afraid that she dropped her bag full of fruit.

##
The erotot looked up and said, "Don't be afraid. I'm only playing with your beautiful baby."

##
So the woman came down from the tree.

##
The erotot took off one of his chains. He gave it to the baby, and said, "Here is a gift for you."

##
Then he said to the woman, "Take your baby, take your bag, and go home. Tell your husband to move to a more peaceful village. Your baby has given me peace."

##
_Note: In the language Ng'aturkana, 'erotot' is the word used to to describe a man who goes ahead to survey an area before before an attack takes place. It is similar to the English word 'scout'._
