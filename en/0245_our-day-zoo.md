# Our day at the zoo

##
Today we are going to the zoo.

##
We are going in dad's car.

##
We are going to see animals.

##
Look!

An elephant.

Look!

A lion.

##
We walk through the whole zoo!

##
Look!

Ice cream.

Look!

Sweets.

##
And there is a clown with balloons.

##
Dad buys us nice things.

##
Soon we must go home.

##
We saw many animals today!

##
We are happy and tired.

##
I wish every day was like today!
