# The seventh sun: A tribal tale from Odisha, India

##
Long, long ago there were seven
suns in the sky.
Their rays made the earth so hot
that human beings could not bear
it.

##
So, the seven brothers belonging to
a tribe called the Munda decided to
kill the suns.
They shot arrows at them and were
able to kill six of the suns.

##
The seventh sun hid behind a hill.

##
Now, with the suns gone, there was
darkness everywhere.
The deer could not see the tigers,
the elephants bumped into trees,
the rabbits walked over the lions
and there was confusion all around.

##
To find a way out, the animals
decided to have a meeting.
A rabbit told them about one of the
seven suns who was still alive and
hiding behind a hill.
But who would be the best one to
call out to the sun?

##
"I will call out to the sun," said the
lion, for he was the king of the
forest.
"Sun, sun, please do not run away
from us. Come back in and shine on
us," roared the lion.
But the sun did not listen to him.

##
The elephant called out next.
He raised his trunk and trumpeted,
"Sun, sun, please come back," but
the sun did not listen to him.

##
The beautiful peacock danced and
pleaded, "Sun, sun, please come
back," but the sun refused to come
out.
One after the other, all the animals
called out to the sun, but he did not
listen to any of them.
Finally, a rooster offered to call the
sun. Everybody laughed. The lion
was a fair leader. He said, "The
rooster should be allowed to try."

##
The rooster stepped forward and
gently crowed, "Kookoodokoo koo."
To everyone's surprise, the sun
peeped out a little from behind the
hill.

##
The rooster crowed again, this time a little boldly,
"KookoodoKOO-KOO..."
The sun came up a little higher. The rooster crowed
for the third time. This time it was louder and bolder,
"KOOKOODOKOO-KOO..." and the sun rose high and
bright.
There was light everywhere.
The animals were delighted and the humans felt
relieved.

##
The animals asked the human
beings not to kill the sun and they
agreed.
Ever since that day, when the
rooster crows in the morning, the
sun rises and shines in the sky.
