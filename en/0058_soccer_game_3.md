# Soccer game

##
We love soccer.

##
Moloko is teaching us
soccer.

##
We are playing soccer.

##
Moloko is the best
teacher!

##
After the game,
Moloko told us that
she has a surprise for
us.

##
But she will only let us
know tomorrow.

##
The next day we all
came early to the field.
We all love surprises.

##
Moloko has new soccer
kits and balls for all of
us!
What a great surprise!
