# My friend Coco

##
When I was five years old, my
uncle gave me a wonderful
present.
It was a three-week-old puppy!
The day my uncle brought the
puppy home, I was very happy.
I knew I had a friend.

##
After putting him down, my
uncle turned to me and asked,
“What name will you give him?”
I looked at my puppy, and said,
“Coco.”
My uncle was surprised.
He asked, “Why do you call him
Coco?”
I said, “Because he looks like
cocoa.”

##
I asked my uncle if Coco was born alone.
My uncle said that there was another puppy,
exactly like Coco.
I went to see Coco's brother.

##
When Coco saw his brother, he
was very excited.
The two of them put their heads
together as if they were talking.

##
I asked my uncle if I could keep
both Coco and his brother.
“All right,” he said. “But you
must look after them.”
So every evening, I played with
them and took them for
exercise.

##
A few months later, Coco and
his brother were big, strong and
healthy.
They were too big for me to
look after on my own.

##
So I asked my uncle to take
back Coco's brother.
But when Coco was left alone,
he looked very sad.
It felt as if he was asking me,
“Why did you do that?”

##
He stopped playing.
Sometimes he refused to go for
a walk with me.
There were times when Coco
ate very little.
I was worried.
I asked myself, “What can I do
to help Coco?”

##
Then one day my uncle came to visit.
When I heard his voice, I rushed out of the house.
Before I could see him, I heard the barking of dogs.

##
Behind the kitchen, dancing
happily before me were Coco
and his brother!

##
I was so happy that I did not
know who to hug first, Coco or
my uncle.
I knew Coco would go back to
his old self now that his brother
was back.
We would go running in the
fields again!
