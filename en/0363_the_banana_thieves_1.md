Long time ago, there were four little friends namely: Joel, Jonah, Job and Jacob.

##
They were studying at Busolwe primary school.

##
The boys used to go to school with out taking tea.

##
They used to feel sleepy at school all the because of hunger.

##
One day, they decided to go to to a nearby trading center called gampe and look for something to eat.

##
After crossing to a nearby trading center, they saw a bigger banana bunch in a box at the veranda.

##
The boys whispered at each other hahahaaaaa ...... we have been very hungry but......, said Jonah.

##
All ran to the veranda. picked up some bananas from the box, smiled and started eating. Do you know what they forgot to do?

##
While eating, the owner of the bananas came walking in bigger strides. "Who has given you my bananas?" asked the man.

##
As soon as they heard that voice, the boys ran as fast as they could and hid somewhere. They said to each other that no laughing, no coughing and no talking.

##
The owner of the bananas made an alarm, "wulululululua, here are the thieves."

##
The boys were arrested, taken to school, called their parents, the teachers, and the school children to gather.

##
The boys were given a punishment. Each got some ten strokes and repented not to steal anything again.
