# Rain for Nomvula

##
“No Nomvula, don't play with
water. It is so scarce!”
“But it's hot, Mama! I feel like
getting into this water. I want to
be cool.”

##
“No, Nomvula. Don't play with
water. Water is scarce.”
“But it's hot, Mama, I'm thirsty.
I'd like to drink cold water.”

##
It is raining. There is going to be
a lot of water. Now I can't play –
I wish it could be hot.

##
Look at the vegetables. They
are growing and becoming
green.
Look! The bowls and buckets
are overflowing with water.

##
It has stopped raining. Now we
can play!
Look how beautiful everything
is after the rain. The sky is clear
and blue. Trees and grass are
green, and the plants are
flowering.

##
Oh no! There the rain is again!
When are we going to play?

##
Oh no, me! I'm going to play,
even if it's raining! Oh it's so
lovely to play in the rain.
Chapha chapha chapha!
Imanz'ilokhwe yam!
Imanz'ilokhwe yam!
Chapha chapha chapha!
Zimanz'iinwele zam!
Zimanz'iinwele zam!

##
Nomvula, you don't want to
listen, my child. Come closer,
let me dry and comb your hair.
Chapha chapha chapha!
Zimanz'iinwele zakho!
Zimanz'iinwele zakho!
