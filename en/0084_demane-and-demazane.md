# Demane and Demazane

##
Once upon a time, there was a boy called Demane.
He had a twin sister called Demazane.
When their mother and father died, they went to stay with their uncle.
But they were badly treated.
They were beaten with long sticks, and given thin porridge only once a day for food.
So they ran away.

##
They found a cave to live in. They
were scared because they had
heard that there were cannibals
living in the hills.
So they made a strong door to
cover the entrance, with only two
holes to let in air and light.
Demane warned his sister, “Stay in
the cave while I am out hunting,
and don't cook any meat. Cannibals
love the smell of cooking meat.”

##
Each evening Demane brought back
something he had killed – a hare or
some birds or a small buck.
As he came to the cave, he sang,
“Demazane, Demazane, child of
my mother, open this cave to me.
The swallows can enter it. It has
two holes.”

##
Demazane found it very boring to
stay in the cave all day. So one day,
when her brother had gone, she
went out to explore.
She found a stream to play in, and
some trees to climb. She felt free
and happy. “Perhaps,” she thought,
“there are no cannibals. Perhaps
Uncle said there were cannibals just
to frighten us.”

##
The next day she felt bold enough to make a fire to warm herself.
But she made it inside the cave with the door firmly shut – just to be on the safe side.
“I'm sure it won't matter if I put a little meat on the fire. It will be so good to have a cooked
meal.”

##
When her brother came home he
sang as usual,
“Demazane, Demazane, child of
my mother, open this cave to me.
The swallows can enter it. It has
two holes.”
She opened the door and let him in.
When he saw the cooked meat,
Demane asked, “How did you do
this without a fire?”
“I dried the meat in the sun outside
the cave,” Demazane replied
quickly. Demane was too tired to
argue, and they sat down to enjoy
the meal together.

##
The next day, she made a fire and
cooked meat again. She had just
finished when a voice sang outside
the door,
“Demazane, Demazane, child of
my mother, open this cave to me.
The swallows can enter it.
It has two holes.”
But the voice did not sound like her
brother's. Demazane said, “No. You
are not my brother. Your voice is not
like his.” She felt safe in the cave.

##
A little while later, someone was
singing outside the cave again, “Do
let me in, my sister.”
“Demazane, Demazane, child of
my mother, open this cave to me.
The swallows can enter it. It has
two holes.”
The voice sounded just like her
brother's, so she opened the door.

##
A huge hairy man filled the opening
of the cave. He grabbed Demazane
before she could run away.
Demazane just had time to pick up
some ashes from the fire.
As she was being carried away, she
dropped some ashes here and there
along the path.

##
That day, all Demane had managed
to trap was a hive full of bees. He
carried them in a thick bag slung
over his shoulder.
When he came to the cave, he
found the door open and his sister
gone...but ashes pointing the way
into the woods.
He followed the ash along the path
until he saw a fire in the distance.

##
Near the fire was a huge hairy man
sitting with a large bag next to him.
Demane walked up to the man,
pretending to limp, “Please, father,
can you help me? I've hurt my leg. I
need some water.”
The man replied, “I'll get you some
water, if you will promise not to
touch my bag.” And he put the bag
carefully in his hut.

##
But when he had gone, Demane cut
the string of the bag, and out
climbed his sister.
Demane replaced the bag with his
own bag full of bees. Brother and
sister hid and waited to see what
would happen.

##
When the man came with the
water, his son and daughter came
with him.
He said to his daughter, “There is
something nice in the bag in our
hut. Go! Bring it!”
She opened the bag a little to see
what it was, but the bees stung her
hand, and she called out, “It is
biting.”
“Go and help her!” he shouted to
his son. But the result was the
same.

##
“Don't treat me like a fool,” he
shouted, and stormed into the hut.
He closed the door and opened the
bag himself.
The angry bees swarmed out and
stung his head, his nose, his eyes.
Blinded, he jumped about, howling
with pain.

##
Then he ran and fell headlong into a
pond, where his head stuck fast in
the mud.
He turned into a piece of wood like
the stump of a tree. Just right for a
bee hive.
For a long time after that, Demane
and Demazane ate delicious honey
from that hive.
