# Adun, the beautiful

##
Adun was very beautiful. All the
men in her village wanted to
marry her. But Adun refused
them all.

##
One market day, a man
borrowed legs from another
man, and arms from another,
and a body from a third man.
Then this man joined all the
parts together. He put his head
on top and went to the market.

##
This man wanted Adun and was
determined to marry her. Adun
was pleased by his appearance.
She wanted to be with him. The
man came from a far town, and
Adun decided to return with
him.

##
As Adun and the man journeyed
to his place, the owner of the
legs took the legs back.
Then the owner of the arms
took his arms back.
And finally the owner of the
body took that back.

##
Only the head was left, and the
head went on. Adun was scared
but she did not run away. They
arrived at the house of the
head.

##
The following morning, before
the head went to his farm, he
spoke to Tortoise. “If Adun tries
to escape, blow this horn to tell
me,” said the head.

##
After the head left, Adun packed
her things. Then she began to
run away.

##
Seeing her, Tortoise blew the
horn, “Head, head, Adun is
about to run away,” puffed
Tortoise.

##
The head went up to Adun and
said, “Where do you think you
are going?”
Adun went back to the head's
house.

##
Eventually Adun consulted a
diviner about what to do. The
diviner advised, “Go and buy
some bean cakes. Soak them in
palm oil and put them in
Tortoise's horn.”

##
Adun followed the diviner's
instructions. She put the oily
cakes into the horn.

##
The following day, she took her
things and began to run away
again. When Tortoise took the
horn to blow it, the delicious
bean cakes fell into his mouth.

##
Tortoise ate, ate and ate.
And Adun ran away.
