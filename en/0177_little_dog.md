# Little Dog

##
One day Little Dog was
playing with a ball.

##
He saw a cat.
He said, “Hello, Little
Cat. Can I play with
you?”
Little Cat said,
“I will play with you.
Can I play with your
ball?”

##
“Yes,” said Little Dog.
“It is a red ball. I will
kick it to you and you
can hit it back to me.”

##
So the two little friends
began to play.
Little Dog said, “I like to
play with you. It is fun.
You are a good friend.”

##
The big red ball went
over the wall. Little Cat
began to cry.
“We do not have a ball
to play with.”

##
“I like to play with the
big red ball,” said Little
Cat.
Little Cat began to cry
and cry.

##
“I will get the ball,” said
Little Dog and he
jumped over the wall.

##
Soon he was back with
the ball.
Little Cat was happy
that it was back.
The two friends played
and played.

##
Little Dog said, “Come
to my house and let us
look at a picture book.”

In the picture book,
they saw a little dog
play ball with a little
cat!
