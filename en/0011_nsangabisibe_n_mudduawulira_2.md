# Nsangabisibe and Mudduawulira

##
There was a man called
Nsangabisibe.

##
This man had a son. The son's
name was Mudduawulira.

##
One day the man said to his
son, “Let's go for a walk.”

##
On the way, they saw a very
nice suitcase. It was packed full.

##
The man got very excited. He
said to Mudduawulira, “Pick it
up and we will take it home.”

##
The son did what the father told
him to do. Mudduawulira put
the suitcase on his head and
carried it.

##
On the way home, a snake
slithered out of the suitcase. It
landed on Mudduawulira's feet!

##
Father and son were both very
scared. Mudduawulira dropped
the suitcase. They ran away
very fast!
