# Nsangabisibe n' Mudduawulira

##
Eddawaliwo omusajja nga ye
Nsangabisibe.

There was a man called
Nsangabisibe.

##
Omusajja ono yalina mutabani
nga ye Mudduawulira.

This man had a son. The son's
name was Mudduawulira.

##
Lumu taata yagamba
mutabaniwe nti jangu
tutambuleko.

One day the man said to his
son, “Let's go for a walk.”

##
Bwe baali batambula,
nebasanga omugugu omusibe
obulungi ennyo. Omugugu nga
gusanyusa okulaba.

On the way, they saw a very
nice suitcase. It was packed full.

##
Taata nakwatibwa amaddu
nagamba Mudduawuliranti,
“Situla omugugu ogwetike
tugutwale eka.”

The man got very excited. He
said to Mudduawulira, “Pick it
up and we will take it home.”

##
Omwana nasitula omugugu
neyetikka.

The son did what the father told
him to do. Mudduawulira put
the suitcase on his head and
carried it.

##
Batambulako katono, omusota
neguva mumugugu
negumugwa kubigere!

On the way home, a snake
slithered out of the suitcase. It
landed on Mudduawulira's feet!

##
Taata ne mutabaniwe batya
nnyo era nebasuula omugugu
nebadduka.

Father and son were both very
scared. Mudduawulira dropped
the suitcase. They ran away
very fast!
