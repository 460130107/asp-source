# The man who lived alone

##
There was a man who
didn't want to live close
to his neighbours. And
he also didn't want his
wife to visit the homes
of her neighbours.

##
One day he went and
built a home way out in
the bush, far from the
homes of his
neighbours.

##
He would go out every
day in the morning and
come home late at
night.

##
One night the man was
very late getting home.
A hyena saw what that
man was doing.

##
The hyena went and
knocked on the door of
the house.

##
The woman, thinking it
was her husband,
opened the door. The
hyena jumped on her
and devoured her.

##
The man, when he
returned home saw that
his wife had been eaten
by a hyena. There was
nothing he could say.

##
All this happened
because he didn't want
to live near his
neighbours.
