# The mango thieves

##
Long time ago, there were four
little boys.

##
They were studying at Pedo
primary school.

##
The boys used to go to school with out taking
breakfast.

##
They used to dose in class
because of hunger.

##
One day, they decided to escape from school
to a nearby place and look for something to
eat.

##
After crossing to a nearby place, they saw a bigger mango tree which was full of
ripe mangoes.

##
The boys looked at each other
and smiled. Aaaaaa ...... we
have been very hungry but......,
said one little boy.

##
All ran to a mango tree. picked up some
mangoes from the mango tree, smiled and
started eating.
Do you now what they forgot to do?

##
While eating, the owner of the mangoes came walking in bigger strides. ''Who
has given you my mangoes?'' asked the man.

##
As soon as they heard that
voice, the boys ran as fast as
they could and hid somewhere.
they said to each other that no
shouting, no coughing and no
talking.

##
The owner of the mangoes made an alarm,
"Wa a a la la la, wa a a la la la, here are the
thieves."

##
The boys were caught, taken to
school, called their parents, the
teachers, and the school
children to gather.

##
The boys were given a punishment. Each got some ten strokes and repented not
to steal anything again.
