# Keeper and his special nursery

##
This is the story of Keeper
and his nursery for
orphaned animals.

##
August was a busy month
for Keeper and his helpers
at the nursery.

##
One year old Mkite
arrived first. She came
in an old green truck.

##
Keeper and his helpers
were very sorry for Mkite.
She was so thin and sad.

##
But soon, Mkite got stronger.
She began to play with the
other animals at the nursery.

##
On another day in August,
a helicopter landed at the
nursery.

##
Keeper and his helpers rushed
outside.
In the helicopter was a small
elephant under big blanket.

##
Ndiwa was under the blanket.
He was five days' old.
Keeper fed Ndiwa with
a bottle.

##
The third orphan that month
was Malea. She arrived at
the nursery on a red tractor.
She was six months' old.

##
Malea the rhinoceros soon
became close friends with
Enkare, a baby buffalo.
They went everywhere
together.

##
One night, everybody was
woken up by the arrival of
Ambia.

##
Ambia was five months' old.
She was weak after her long
journey.

##
Because of her long neck,
Keeper held the bottle high
to feed Ambia.

##
Tiny twins Abei and Moit
arrived in the middle of
August.
These antelopes were only
a few hours' old. They were
very sick.

##
Everyone was sad when Abei
died a week after he arrived
at the nursery.
But Keeper and his helpers
saved Moit.

##
The last orphans to arrive in
August were Kopi, Kepi and
Keji.
These cubs were two weeks'
old.
They were very hungry when
they arrived.

##
Keeper and his helpers love
all of the animals, even the
naughty ones.

##
The naughtiest baby was
Lobolia.
Lobolia liked to hide Keeper's
glasses.

##
The people at the nursery
work hard to look after
the baby animals.
They hope that one day
the orphans can look after
themselves.
Then these animals can
return to the wild.
