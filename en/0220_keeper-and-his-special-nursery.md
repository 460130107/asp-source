# Keeper and His Special Nursery

##
This is the story of Keeper and his nursery for orphaned animals.

##
Last month was a busy month at the nursery. The first one to arrive at the nursery was one-year old Nomsa. She was thin and sad.

##
But soon, Nomsa got stronger. She began to play with the other animals.

##
On another day that month, a helicopter landed at the nursery.

##
In the helicopter was a small elephant under a big blanket. Her name was Ndiwa.

##
Ndiwa was five days old. Keeper fed Ndiwa with a bottle.

##
One night, everybody was woken up by the arrival of Ambia, a giraffe.

##
Ambia was five months' old. She was weak after her long journey.

##
Because of her long neck, Keeper held the bottle high to feed Ambia.

##
The last orphans to arrive that month were three hungry cubs. Their names were Kopi, Kepi and Keji.

##
Keeper and his helpers love all of the animals, even the naughty ones.

##
The people at the nursery work hard. They hope that one day the orphans can look after themselves. Then these animals can return to the wild.
