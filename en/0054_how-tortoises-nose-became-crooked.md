# How tortoise's nose became crooked

##
Once upon a time,
Tortoise and Squirrel
were very close friends.
One day, Squirrel said
to Tortoise, “My friend,
we have no money, but
market day is getting close.
What business can we do
to make some money?”

##
Tortoise responded,
“You know I can make
clay plates. I want you to
join me in making plates
to sell.”
“Okay my friend, tomorrow
evening I will join you to
make the plates,” Squirrel
said.

##
On the day of the market,
Tortoise went to the
marketplace.
He saw two people fighting
in the distance. He put down
his clay plates and went
to watch the fight.

##
When Tortoise got there,
he saw that it was his
friend Squirrel fighting
with Mole.

##
Immediately, without finding
out what caused the fight,
Tortoise took a big stick
and began to beat Mole.
“Leave my friend alone!”
shouted Tortoise.

##
Mole turned to face
Tortoise and bit him
deeply on the nose.

##
Tortoise's nose began to bleed.

##
Tortoise had impatiently
entered into the fight.
Since that day, Tortoise
has a crooked nose to
remind him not to be
so hasty.
