# The girl who got rich

##
Once upon a time, there lived
two sisters called Nelima and
Nambuya. Their parents were
dead. They lived on bare land.
There was neither rain nor
crops to eat. Whoever wanted
food had to go a long distance
to find any.

##
Nelima was a humble, quiet and
helpful girl. Her sister Nambuya
was proud and she would not
listen to advice. She did not
care about other people.

##
One day, the two sisters woke
up in the morning and found
that they had nothing to eat.
They had to look for food. So
Nelima and Nambuya went off
in different directions.

##
Meanwhile, there lived an old
woman called Netasile. She was
believed to be a giver of riches.
Netasile had leprosy and her
body was full of sores.

##
Nambuya came across this old
woman, who called her, “My
daughter, how are you? Where
do you come from? Where are
you going?”

##
Nambuya answered all the
questions. Then the old woman
said, “Come carry me to my
house and I will tell you what to
do.” Nambuya was rude to the
woman. She said, “I would
rather die than touch those
disgusting sores of yours.”

##
The old woman kept quiet and
wished her a safe journey.

##
Nambuya walked until she
reached a strange place. A
place where there were
millipedes, snakes, caterpillars
and many other insects.
Nambuya was very tired and
weak because she had not
eaten anything. When she sat
down to rest, these creatures
preyed on her.

##
On her journey, Nelima came to
the same woman. She was
happy to see Netasile, being
the first person she met since
starting her journey. The old
woman called her and asked
the same questions.

##
Nelima agreed to carry Netasile
to her house. “You have done
what many have failed to do,”
said the old woman. She gave
Nelima a stick and told her to
go back home, where she would
find everything she wanted.

##
Nelima was very grateful and
thanked the old woman and ran
back home. She found a new
house with everything in it, and
a lot of food. She became the
richest woman in the land.

##
But she mourned for the loss of
her sister and she said, “One
who did not listen to advice
ended up in an elephant's
mouth.”
