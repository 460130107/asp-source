# My new shirt

##
Samba's dad bought him a new
school shirt last market day.

##
Now Samba never misses
school and it has become his
best friend.

##
Samba likes playing football in
his new shirt.

##
He makes it dirty every day and
does not want to wash it.

##
In the field, he wants everyone
to see his new shirt.

##
In the morning he goes to
school with the dirty shirt and
finds the teacher at the gate.

##
Samba dodges school that day
and goes across the road to
play football.

##
Unfortunately the new shirt
gets torn.
And Samba is punished for
dodging school and tearing the
new school shirt.
