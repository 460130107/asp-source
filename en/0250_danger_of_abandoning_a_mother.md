# Danger of abandoning a mother

##
There lived a man called
Lodipo.
He lived with his two wives,
Akai and Akitela.

##
Lodipo's first wife, Akai, was the
only one who helped his blind
mother.

##
One day, Lodipo's younger wife,
Akitela, said, “Let us move
away to a safer village.”
The current place was
constantly attacked by cattle
raiders and Akitela felt unsafe.

##
Lodipo told Akitela that they
could not leave his blind
mother.
But Akitela insisted that they
should move and leave the old
woman alone.
“If you don't move away from
here, I will return to my
parents,” Akitela cried to
Lodipo.

##
Lodipo loved Akitela very much
so he gave in to her demands
and they prepared to leave.
The first wife, Akai, watched all
these happenings with
confusion.

##
Lodipo's blind mother sat on a
goat skin under a tree.
She was unaware of what was
going on.
“How can we leave her on her
own?” Akai wondered.

##
Lodipo and his two wives loaded
all their belongings on their two
camels.
They left quietly without even
saying goodbye to the old
woman.
But Akai was crying because
she was sad to leave her
mother-in-law all alone.

##
The old woman was left alone in the manyatta.
She cried and sang this sad song:
“Awesita Lodipo Ngina Ekitae Ka ng'akinei,
Nakolong kedounio,
Nitonoma tani Akolong'a Awesiti ngina,
Awesiti a Lodipo ngina Eriamaros morua polonia.”

##
Immediately after Lodipo and
his wives had left, raiders
attacked the village.

##
The raiders asked the old
woman to tell them where her
son went.
The warriors told her that they
would go after her son and kill
him.
The old woman pleaded with
them not to kill the first wife
and her children.

##
She also told them to bring
back her ram that Lodipo took
with him.

##
The warriors followed Lodipo.
When he was just settling down
in the new place, they caught
up with him.
They killed him and his young
wife.

##
The first wife, Akai, went back
with the ram to live with the old
woman.
