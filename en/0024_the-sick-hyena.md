# The Sick Hyena

##
Once upon a time, a long time
ago, there was a time of great
hunger. A very smart hyena
pretended he was so sick he
couldn't even go out.

##
Lots of animals went to visit him
in his home to comfort him. But
none of them ever came out!

##
One beautiful afternoon, the
rabbit arrived. He thought he
would like to visit the hyena
too.

##
He almost went into the
hyena's cave. But suddenly he
stopped, and saw there were
only tracks of animals going in,
and none coming out.

##
So he stayed outside and
shouted into it, "How are you?
Are you healthy, my best
friend? Are you getting better?"

##
The hyena answered, "Don't
worry, my friend. Come in and
give me some lovely company!"

##
“Oh, I'm not sure if I should come in. Really, I don't have
time right now,
and you have so many visitors . . .”

“No, no, rabbit, everything is alright. There's nobody in
here. It's no good
for me to stay here all sick and alone.”

##
"You are lying! I can see the
footprints of animals that have
gone in but haven't come out . .
.“

##
The hyena went quiet and the
rabbit said, “Good-bye, my
friend, I think I will visit you
another day.”

##
And the rabbit ran far away
from that place!
