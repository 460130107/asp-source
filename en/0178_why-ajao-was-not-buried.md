# Why Ajao was not buried

##
Ajao, a bat, lay in his house very ill.

There was no one to attend to him.

##
Then, Ajao died.

##
The neighbours said, "Ajao is dead. We must call his relations to come and bury him."

##
The neighbours went and called the birds saying, "A relative of yours is dead."

##
The birds came and saw that it was Ajao.

They said, "This animal is not part of our family."

##
"All our family have feathers but Ajao has none. So, he is not one of us."

The birds went away.

##
The neighbours reasoned together. They agreed, "The birds are right. Ajao has no feathers. So, he is not their relative."

##
One of them said, "He must be part of the family of rats. He looks like them."

##
The neighbours went and called the rats saying, "One of your family is dead."

##
The rats came and saw that it was Ajao.

They said, "This animal is not part of our family."

##
"Everyone in our family has a tail. Ajao has no tail."

The rats went away.

##
No relations were found for Ajao and he remained unburied.
