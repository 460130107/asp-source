# The boy who would not listen

##
Once upon a time, a little boy named Eissa was at
home. He did not like to listen. One day his parents
gave him a song,"Never eat x2, without washing,
your hands. Never eat without washing your hands".
Eissa didn't want to listen at all, so he ignored his
parents. Neither did his sister Aysha

##
He ran into a big lion on the way to the forest. He said "Release me and i will give you pure
fruit that does not need to be washed at all." "Really? What type of fruit." Asked Eissa.

##
"Okay. I will set you free" said Eissa. "On condition you give me a pure fruit" said Eissa. The
lion was very happy and gave Eissa a pure apple.

##
Eissa ate the apple happily and
went home not thinking about it. He
soon got stomach upset. His
parents and siblings saw that there
was something wrong with him.
Eissa was pretending not to be sick

A few days passed and his stomach
upset did not stop at all. He finally
told his parents about his issues.
"Did you eat anything bad?" asked
his mother. ?Did you eat something
bad?"

##
"Why did you eat that fruit Eissa?" His elder brothers
Ken and Sean asked him." A lion told me that it was
clean and..." said Eissa before Ken interrupted him.
"Wait! Let me get this strait! YOU SPOKE TO A LION"
said Ken. "HAHAHAHAH" his brothers burst into
laughter. Eissa felt very ashamed, embarrassed and
sad. He ran to his room and banged the door angrily.

##
'Why do they make fun of me. Why.
I feel so embarrassed. I wish i had
never accepted to eat that apple
the talking lion gave me"
