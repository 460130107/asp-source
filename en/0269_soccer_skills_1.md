# Soccer skills

##
Once upon a time there
lived a boy called
Joseph who liked
football.
He could kick the ball
using either of his two
legs.

##
Joseph plays the ball
using his head.

##
Sometimes he controls
the ball using his chest.

##
One day he dribbled
through the defenders
using the outside of his
foot.

##
If the ball comes from
the air, he controls it
very well using his
thigh.

##
He also dribbles the ball
very well using the
inside of his foot.

##
He traps the ball using
his instep.

##
One time he volleyed
the ball using his
instep.

##
But he could not score
because the keeper
caught the ball.

##
The keeper also
punched the ball which
was shot by Joseph.
