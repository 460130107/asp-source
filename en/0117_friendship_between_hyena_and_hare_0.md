# Friendship between Hyena and Hare

##
Hare and Hyena
were friends.
They decided
to farm potatoes
together.

##
They worked hard
on the farm.

##
After work,
Hare and Hyena
played together.

##
But sometimes
Hyena chased Hare.
Hare would
run away.

##
One day,
Hare asked,
"If you are my friend,
why do you chase me?"

##
Then Hare asked,
"But if you are
not my friend,
why do we work
and play together?"

##
A friend is someone
who is always a friend.
