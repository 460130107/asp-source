# Narrow escape

##
There lived a woman.

##
She had a baby and a pet cat.

##
It was a wonder cat, it could signal to the master
whenever the baby cried.

##
One day the master went for a safari, on her return
the pet cat seemed to have forgotten its usual
behavior, the mother watched for a signal but to
know avail.

##
The cat was busy liking its mouth parts and paws
that were stained with blood.

##
Disturbed with this sight, mother baby searched the
house but could not see the baby but only blood
stained bed sheets.

##
She reached for the gun and targeted to finish the
cat, fortunately the bullet missed the gun fire woke
up the baby who was deep a sleep.

##
Beside the bed, there lay a big snake that the cat
had fought and successfully killed.
