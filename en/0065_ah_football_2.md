# Ah! Football!

##
I like playing with my
friend Chuma.


##
Chuma and I like each
other.
When we are sent, we
go together.


##
One day I was sent by
my grandmother to the
shop to buy salt and
cooking oil.
I went with Chuma.


##
On the way, we saw our
friends playing football.


##
I wanted to play the ball
very much.
I said, “Ah! Football.”


##
I said to Chuma, “Let’s
go and ask them to let
us play with them. I like
playing football very
much.”


##
Chuma replied, “Let us
go to the shop first then
we can come to play.”


##
But I told Chuma, “Let
us play first! If we go
home, grandmother will
not allow us.”


##
Our friends allowed us
to play the ball with
them.
I was the goal keeper.


##
I worked hard to catch
the ball.
My friends were not
able to score any goals.


##
The field was full of
sand.
The goal posts were
made of two big stones.


##
After the game, we
went to the shop but we
had lost the money.
I started to cry.
Chuma said, “Stop
crying. You wanted us
to play before going to
the shop.”


##
We returned home
without salt or cooking
oil.
We were very dirty and
worried.


##
Grandmother was very
annoyed when we
reached home.
The first question she
asked us was, “Where
were you all this time?”


##
She forgave us but
warned us, "Never go to
play again without
permission.”


##
We quickly went to feed
the ducks.
Later on, we cleaned
ourselves.
