# Sundya's smelly mouth

##
Sundya is a pupil at Buwesa
primary school.

##
Every day he goes to school and
every one likes him at school but
never brushes his teeth.

##
He keeps laughing and smiling even
when the other pupils are not.

##
He shares a desk with other four
pupils but they dislike and always
shout at him.

##
At play time, all his friends leave
him alone.

##
Sundya is now worried because no
one wants to be near him though he
performs well in class.

##
The teacher then advices Sundya to
clean his teeth and mouth every
day.

##
Next day he comes back at school
with the teeth so white and the
mouth clean.
Now every one is back to him like
before.
