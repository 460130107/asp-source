# My teacher

##
I love my teacher.

##
She is beautiful. She is
a good teacher. She is
kind and patient.

##
She has braided her
hair very nicely today.

##
She has decorated her
hair with colourful
beads.

##
Her beads are green,
white, red, and yellow.

##
Mom, please would you
braid my hair like my
teacher's?

##
When I am older I will
also put beads in my
hair.

##
I will grow up to be just
like my teacher!
