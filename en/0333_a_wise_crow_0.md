# A wise crow

##
A crow was thirsty. He moved a very long
distance in search for water for drinking but
failed.

##
He then tried to fly back. To the tree where he
was living. It took him a long time because he
was weak.

##
As he was moving he saw water in a pot in
someone's compound.

##
The water was almost at the bottom of the pot.
His beak could not reach the water in the pot.
He thought of a way to get that water.

##
An idea came to his mind.
Hegot small stones He dropped one stone and
the water in the pot jumped.

##
The crow put his mouth and drunk the water
droplets.

##
He got another stone and repeated the
exercise. He kept on doing this until he was
satisfied..
