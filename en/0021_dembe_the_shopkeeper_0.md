# Dembe the shopkeeper

##
In my home village,
there is a trader called
Dembe.

##
Dembe has a big shop
in the village.

##
The shop sells flour,
sugar, rice, beans, and
many more things.

##
Dembe and his wife
have three children.
They all work hard in
the shop.

##
During the holidays, the
children help their
parents to serve
customers. They count
the money and give
change.

##
Dembe has a business
book. He keeps records
in this book every day.

##
Dembe and his wife
have a good house and
a car.

##
They keep goats, cows,
chickens and rabbits.
Their life is good.

##
Dembe and his wife
have enough money to
pay school fees for their
children.
