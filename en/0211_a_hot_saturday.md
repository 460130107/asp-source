# A hot Saturday

##
It was a very very hot
Saturday.
Everyone was grumpy.

##
“Let's go to the river,”
Lerato said.
“But Mme told us not to
swim in the river,” said
Bontle.
“We won't swim,”
answered Lerato. “We'll
just play in the shade
next to the water.”

##
First we took off our
shoes.
But we were still hot.
Then we took off our
shirts and skirts.
But we were still hot.

##
We put our feet in the
river to cool off.
Then we splashed each
other.

##
We swam and swam
and forgot about the
time.

##
The sun started to go
down, and we felt chilly.
Where were our
clothes?

##
We looked everywhere:
under the trees, on the
bushes.

##
There were some cows
near the river.
Bontle looked up, “Look
at that cow! She's
eating your shirt!”

##
“The cows ate our
clothes!”
But did Mme believe
us?
Soon our bottoms were
very warm. And it
wasn't from the sun.
