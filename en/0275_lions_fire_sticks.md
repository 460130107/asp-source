# Lion's fire sticks

##
This story is in the old time
when people and animals lived
together. At that time, people
did not have fire. They ate their
food raw. Only Lion had fire.

##
The people and animals wanted
fire. The people and the animals
had a meeting. “We want to
cook our food'” they said. “How
can we get the fire from Lion?”

##
In the evening they started
singing and dancing. They
called to all the animals, “come
dance with us, come dance with
us!” Many animals came to join
them.

##
Lion came too. He brought his
fire sticks. He rubbed his sticks
together. He rubbed and rubbed
until at last there was a little
smoke. Lion blew on the sticks,
and then there was a little fire.
Everyone brought a stick for
that fire. Then there was a big
fire.

##
The people and the animals were so happy! They sang and
danced around the fire.

##
The people and the animals wanted to take Lion's fire
sticks. They thought of a good plan. They called rabbit.
“We all know that you are very clever and very fast.” When
Lion is dancing and singing, you must take his fire sticks
and run!”

##
So Rabbit took Lion's fire sticks
and ran as fast as he could. But
Lion saw rabbit, and ran after
him. He caught rabbit and
brought the fire sticks back.

##
Then lion sang his song: “I have
no problem. I can eat you all. I
can eat you with hair. I can eat
you without hair. All of you are
food for me!”

##
The people still wanted Lion's
fire sticks. They thought of
another plan. They called
springbok. “We all know that
you can jump very high and run
very fast,” they said. When Lion
is dancing and singing, you
must take his fire sticks and
run!”

##
So springbok took Lion's fire
sticks and ran as fast as he
could. But Lion said, “I don't
hear springbok's feet dancing.”
He turned and saw springbok
running away into the veld. He
caught springbok and brought
the fire sticks back.

##
Again lion sang his song: “I
have no problem. I can eat you
all. I can eat you with hair. I can
eat you without hair. All of you
are food for me!”

##
The people still wanted Lion's
fire sticks. They thought of
another plan. They called
ostrich. “We all know that you
have the longest and strongest
legs of all of us,” they said.
When Lion is dancing and
singing, you must take his fire
sticks and run!”

##
So ostrich took Lion's fire sticks
and ran as fast as he could. But
Lion said, “I don't hear ostrich's
sweet singing voice anymore.”
He turned and saw ostrich
running away into the veld.

##
After a long, long time, Lion
came back. He was very, very
tired. He was very, very angry.
He did not have his fire sticks.
Ostrich was too fast for him.

##
Then Lion spoke to all the
people and all the animals.
“From this day on,” he said,
“you must all be very, very
careful. I will hunt you, and
chase you, and when I catch
you I will eat you.”

##
And so this is how people came
to have fire. And this how Lion
came to be the enemy of all
animals and all people.
