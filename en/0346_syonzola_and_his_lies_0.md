# Syonzola and his lies

##
A story is told of a man who lived in a far away village with
his son. His name was Syonzola and he was a very
mischievous man. People in the village didn't like him very
much because he liked to lie a lot.

##
At night, Syonzola would wait until everyone was asleep and
he would stand outside and start shouting, "HELP, HELP, I'M
BEING ATTACKED. PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME."

##
The people would come running to help him with spears in
their hands."Hahahahahaha" Syonzola would laugh until his
stomach was sore when he saw them.

##
"Are you ok?"
"Where is the animal that was
attacking you?" People would shout
"It went that way, please help,"
Syonzola would say to them and
point at the darkness behind the
trees.
After they had searched the whole
village and found no vicious
animal, they would tell him to stop
his lies and go to sleep.

##
One night his son heard him screaming and shouting for help
again. His son never understood why his dad liked to prank
people. But on this night his son didn't hear people opening
their doors and running to help, he only heard his father

##
The other villagers were not in the mood to wake up because
they knew Syonzola was up to his old tricks again. So they
decided to sleep and wait for him to stop his loud screams.

##
"Help, Help me please," his son waited and waited. But this
time he could sense that something was terribly wrong
because now he was hearing something else that sounded
scary and his father's cries were much louder than normal.

##
So the boy ran out and saw that the vicious animal was
attacking his father. And he was brave and weaved his fire
stick at the animal and the animal ran away from the fire.

##
The animal ran very fast into the
darkness. Syonzola was so proud to
see how brave his son was.
He was very grateful to his son for
saving him from the vicious animal
that night.

##
From that day Syonzola never told a lie again and was
forever grateful to his son for saving his life. Instead of
screaming "Help Help" he now told everyone in the village
about his brave son.
