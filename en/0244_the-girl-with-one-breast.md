# The girl with one breast

##
A long time ago, there was a
man who lived with his wife
whom he loved very much.
One day he took a walk to the
forest. Along the way, he met a
tall, slender, and very beautiful
girl.
He fell in love with her at first
sight. The girl too readily
accepted him.
But she told him that she had
only one breast.

##
So she told him to go home, cut
off one of his wife's breasts and
bring it to her. Then she would
have two breasts, and they
could marry.
The man ran very fast back
home, picked a knife, pounced
on his dear wife, and the breast
was off instantly.

##
He hurried back to the forest to
where he had left his newfound
darling.
But she was nowhere to be
seen. He called her name very
loudly, but there was complete
silence.
Then he heard a voice saying,
"Why are you calling? Don't you
know that you are in the forest
area of Musambwa kwa
Libeeletwela?"

##
When the man heard that, he
ran home as fast as a bullet ...
Only to find his wife had just
died.
He was so grief stricken
because of what he had done
that he too died.
