# My Village

##
The main activities in our village are,
farming, fishing, brick making and trading.
People depend on these activities to get
money for themselves. With this money they
are able to build good, permanent houses
for themselves pay school fees for their
children.

I live in a small village called Awe. This
village is 10km from the District
headquarters. Our nearest clinic called hope
centre clinic. There are two main tribes
including : The Acholis. The people in our
village live happily.

##
However brick making has been misused in some ways. The young
generation, especially the boys, have left schools at an early age
to do the hardworking in brick making. The government, however,
is trying to find ways to helping my village my village by
encouraging children to go and stay in school.
