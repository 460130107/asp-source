# Tselane and the giant

##
Once upon a time there was a little
girl called Tselane.
After her father died, Tselane was
left alone with her mother.
One day her mother told Tselane
that they were moving to a nearby
village to start a new life.

##
Tselane did not want to leave her
village and she cried very hard.
Her mother was scared to leave her
alone because this village was
known to have many giants living in
caves nearby.
But Tselane cried so much that her
mother gave in and agreed that she
could stay behind.

##
Tselane's mother said that she
would bring her food every day.
“I will sing a song and you will know
that it's me. Don't open the door for
anyone else, my child,” said
Tselane's mother.

##
Tselane my child!
Tselane my child!
Come out and eat your porridge!
Come out and eat your porridge!
Tselane ngwanaka!
Tselane ngwanaka!
Tla o tseye bogobe o je.
Tla o tseye bogobe o je!

##
The next morning Tselane's mother
came to the house to bring Tselane
her food.
She started singing:
Tselane my child! Come out and eat
your porridge!
Tselane opened the door and ate
her mother's delicious food.

##
Her mother kissed her and went
back to her home.
Tselane went back inside her house
and prepared her bed.
But a giant was hiding behind the
bushes, watching and listening to
Tselane and her mother!

##
When Tselane switched off her light,
she heard a deep voice singing her
mother's song outside the door:
Tselane my child!
Come out and eat your porridge!
“Go away! You are not my mother!”
said Tselane.“You are a giant!”
The giant walked away
disappointed and disappeared into
the caves.

##
Every morning and every evening,
Tselane's mother brought her food.
Every morning and every evening,
the giant also came.
But each time Tselane sent him
away.
She recognised his deep voice as he
tried to sing her mother's song.

##
One day the giant came up with an
idea: “I can change my voice to
resemble that of Tselane's mother!”
He made a big fire and threw a
round smooth stone into the fire.
When the stone was very hot and
red, he took it out of the fire and
swallowed it!
“Kudutlu!” went the hot stone
through the throat of the giant.

##
The giant started singing to hear if
his voice had changed.
He jumped for joy when he heard
his voice sounding as sweet as that
of Tselane's mother!

##
Early the next day, the giant went to Tselane's house very early in
the morning. When he got to the door of the house, he started
singing:
Tselane my child!
Tselane my child!
Come out and eat your porridge!
Come out and eat your porridge!
Tselane ngwanaka!
Tselane ngwanaka!
Tla o tseye bogobe o je.
Tla o tseye bogobe o je!

##
Tselane was excited to hear her
mother's sweet voice.
She opened the door, and there was
the giant!
She tried to close the door but the
giant was too quick.
He grabbed Tselane and threw her
into a sack.

##
The giant walked back to his cave,
singing and happy.
“If only I had traditional beer, it
would go so well with my dinner
tonight. What a beautiful day!” he
said to himself.

##
A little later in the morning,
Tselane's mother came as usual to
bring her daughter food.
She sang her song, but Tselane did
not come out. She sang her song
again, but still Tselane did not come
out.
After singing for the third time, she
kicked the door open. Tselane was
nowhere to be found. She knew
what had happened, and she
quickly thought of a plan.

##
She poured some beer into a big
calabash, put it on her head, walked
down to the caves and knocked on
the giant's door.
The giant smelled the delicious
smell of traditional beer and opened
the door quickly.
“Good evening, giant!” said
Tselane's mother.
“I was passing through and I heard
you singing beautifully. I am going
to another village for a child's
birthday party.”

##
The giant was not going to let the opportunity of
drinking traditional beer pass him by!
He invited Tselane's mother into his cave.
“Let me pour you some beer before I get back on the
road,” said Tselane's mother.
The giant was very happy and drank the beer in one
gulp.

##
Tselane's mother gave him more
and more - and more - until the
calabash was empty.
By now the giant was so drunk that
he fell asleep on the floor.

##
When Tselane's mother heard the
giant's loud snores, she opened the
sack and out jumped Tselane.
Tselane and her mother ran home
as fast as they could.
From then on Tselane lived with her
mother at the new village – very
happily!
