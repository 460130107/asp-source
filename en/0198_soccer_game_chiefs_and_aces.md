# Soccer game Chiefs and Aces

##
The day that we've been talking
about has come. We are going
to play soccer. Chiefs versus
Aces.
Come and watch!
Come with your vuvuzela!

##
Wonderful Chiefs, the cup must
come to sleep at home.
I want us to work together as a
team in order to defeat Aces.
We must attack wisely, be
careful, and pass to each other.

##
Pass the ball, pass it, Portia,
Modise!
Defend, defend, Jomo!
There it is, there it is, let it go to
the goals!

##
You played wonderfully, my
beautiful Chiefs!
You attacked wisely, you were
careful, and you shared the ball.
You played as a real team!

##
â€˜High Five! Give yourselves a
hand!' says the coach.

##
Oh! We are tired, but it was
good to prepare ourselves.
When is the match, Coach?

##
The day came that we were
waiting for. The coach brought
us the kit.
Halala Chiefs, halala!
It's going to be a good game.
The cup is ours!

##
Our kit is so beautiful! Thank
you, coach! You are a wonderful
coach!
