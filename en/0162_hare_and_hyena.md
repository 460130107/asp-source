# Hare and Hyena

##
Long time ago Hare and Hyena
were great friends.
They did many things together.
They danced and sang together.

##
One day, Hare said, “My friend
Hyena, let us start farming together
and we will be rich.”
“Oh yes, we can plant a lot food,
harvest it, and sell it to others,”
Hyena said.
“But what shall we plant?” asked
Hare.

##
Hyena suggested that it was good
to plant maize. Hare agreed.
Hare also told Hyena that it was
good for them to share duties on
the farm.
“My work will be guarding the
maize from birds,” said Hare.
Then Hare told Hyena to till the
land, plant, and weed.

##
Hyena complained that he had been
given more work. But Hare told
Hyena that the work of chasing
birds was the most difficult and
most important.
“My work is not easy. I will be
climbing trees and chasing birds
away day and night. And you are
not able to climb a tree,” Hare
explained.

##
Hyena was convinced by Hare's
words. He agreed to till the land
alone. It was a lot of work. Hare did
not help at all.
After tilling the land, Hyena planted
maize in the whole field, alone.

##
When weeds grew in the field,
Hyena used a hoe to weed. It was a
lot of work.
Hare sat on a rock singing:
“My friend is a worker,
I am his adviser.
He works like a tractor,
I am his manager.
The soil he toils,
The hills he tills,
The seeds he plants,
The weeds he cuts,
The maize we harvest.”

##
When the maize was almost ready,
Hare enjoyed himself singing in the
field to keep birds away. Chasing
the birds was not a hard job. He did
not sweat at all.

##
Finally, the maize was ready to
harvest. Hare told Hyena that they
would share the harvest between
themselves.
Hare said, “I will harvest everything
that grows above the soil and you
will harvest everything that grows
below the soil.”
Hyena thought that it was a good
idea.

##
Hare said, “I will first get my
harvest then you will harvest
yours.”
So Hare harvested all the maize in
the field and put it in his store.

##
Hyena went to harvest things that
grew below the soil. He dug, hoping
to get a good harvest. But he only
found roots under the soil. He dug
everywhere. He did not find
anything to harvest.

##
Hyena realised that he had been
cheated. He was angry. He returned
home carrying empty baskets.
In the evening he went to Hare's
home very annoyed. He told Hare,
“Let us now farm together again my
friend.”

##
Hyena told Hare, “This time I will
harvest everything that grows
above the ground and you will
harvest everything that grows
below the soil.”
Hare accepted. He told Hyena that
instead of planting maize it was
good to change the crop. They
agreed to plant potatoes.

##
Hyena also insisted that this time
they would both do the digging,
planting and weeding. Hare
accepted. So they worked on the
farm together, singing.

##
When the potatoes were ready,
Hare told Hyena to harvest what
grows above the ground.
Hyena went looking for something
to harvest. But he did not find
anything. He only found potato
leaves. He went back home with
empty baskets.

##
Hare harvested a lot of big
potatoes. He put them in his store.
When Hyena saw Hare's harvest, he
was annoyed. “Why did you cheat
me?” Hyena asked Hare.
Hare explained that it was Hyena
himself who chose to harvest the
things that grew above the soil.

##
Hyena was very angry. He chased
after Hare in order to get revenge.
But Hare ran away fast.
Since that day, Hare and Hyena
have not been friends.
