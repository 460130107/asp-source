# Crushed louse

##
Long time ago, there were two
young men who lost their cows.
They looked for the cows until it
was late.

##
As it got dark, they saw a light
in a house.
They agreed to go and ask for a
place to sleep.

##
They went to the house and
knocked.
The door opened and they went
in.
The young men didn't see
anyone. But they heard a voice
greeting them.

##
The voice said, “I am a louse.
Open the pot and have food.
Open the earthenware pot and
drink amahewu.”

##
Then the louse put on its skin
and went out.

##
The young men ate, drank, and
gave thanks.
They left the house.

##
As they left, they had a bad
thought.
They said, “No, it couldn't
happen that we had food from a
louse.”
Eventually they agreed to go
back and crush the louse.

##
They went back to the house
and crushed the louse.
Suddenly the louse was gone,
and the house disappeared!
They found themselves outside
in the open.
