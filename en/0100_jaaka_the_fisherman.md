# Jaaka the fisherman

##
This is Jaaka the
fisherman from
Naminya.

##
He fishes on the river
Nile.

##
He has a boat, fishing
net and a hook.

##
He always wakes up
very early in the
morning to catch the
Nile perch.

##
At around 10am, he's
selling his catch in Jinja
central market.

##
Jaaka what happened?
Was it a loss? He's so
sad.

##
“Today the situation is
bad. The Nile breeze did
not permit me to fish.
And one perch swam
away with my hook.”

##
“But I have hope that
tomorrow will be good,
because I've bought a
new hook.”
