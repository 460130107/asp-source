# The talking bag

##
Once upon a time there was a
female giant.
As she was walking near the lake
one day, she found three little girls.
She asked them, “Who among you
is loved by both parents?”

##
One of the girls said, "My mother
loves me most."
Another said, "My father loves me
most."
But the third one said, "I am loved
by both parents."

##
The giant then asked the girl loved
by both parents to help her put a
load of firewood on her back.
So the girl followed the giant.

##
After going for some distance, the
girl asked the giant, “Where is your
firewood?”
The giant replied, “It is near those
trees over there!”

##
When they reached the trees, the
girl asked again, “Where is your
firewood?”
The giant answered, “Not far now!”

##
They walked on and met a man.
He asked the giant, “What is the
name of your child?”
The giant replied, “She is called the
‘talking bag'.”

##
The girl burst out singing:
“I am not called the talking bag.
My name is Kaamungei!
Oh! My mother, whom I love,
Oh! My father, whom I love,
Oh! My calabash, which I use to
drink milk!”

##
When the man heard what the girl
sang, he rescued her and took her
back to her parents.
The story ends there!
