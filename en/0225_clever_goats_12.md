# Clever goats

##
Once up on a time, a man had two
goats , he used to keep them in a
goats house and shut the door
every evening .
In the morning he opened them
and took them to graze.
He used to tether them where
there was no enough grass.

##
As such they never got satisfied.
One night, the goats discussed how
to open the and get out to go and
find what to eat.
One goat found a way of opening
the door. They went out and ate
potato vines belonging to that
home. After eating they went back
to the house and shut the door.

##
In the morning the man, discovered
that his vines had been eaten by
some animals, he could not
suspect his neighbors goats.
In the night, the goats opened and
ate the vines.

##
The following morning the man
found the vines eaten, he
quarreled and quarreled, he
planned to be checking on his
vines at night.
In the middle of the night , he
came out with a spear, he tip toed
towards the goats , aimed and
threw the spear.

##
One goat was speared and they all
ran away, the man entered the
house.
In the morning he went to check
for what he had speared, only to
find out that he had speared his
own goat.
He was very sorry about the
incident.
