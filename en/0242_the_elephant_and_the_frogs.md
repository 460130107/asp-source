# The Elephant and the Frogs

##
A long time ago, the
king of the bush was Mr.
Lion.

##
He sent his animals to
stop the noise coming
from a small lake in the
bush. But they did not
succeed!

##
An elephant
volunteered to stop it.
The elephant was sent
out as a guard.

##
At midnight the noise
began and the elephant
started killing the frogs.
He did the same thing
the next day.

##
After a couple of weeks,
King Lion was happy
because the elephant
had stopped the noise.

##
But about a month
later, they saw a lot of
insects on their farm.

##
King Lion asked the
elephant to call the
frogs to come and eat
the insects.

##
The elephant was very
nervous because he
had killed all of them.
He said: Sorry, sorry, I
k- k- k- killed them!

##
Then King Lion said:
Elephant, I asked you to
stop the noise, not to
kill the frogs. And the
elephant was put in
prison for many years!

##
And the king told all the
animals to always do
exactly what he said.
