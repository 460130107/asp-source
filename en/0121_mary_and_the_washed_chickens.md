# Mary and the washed chickens

##
It was the first wedding in the
Roberts family, and Mary had never
been so excited in her life.
"My chickens, I am going to be John
and Hawa's bridesmaid, with a new
dress and shoes!" she said to her
chickens.
Mary told her chickens everything.
Her father had given the chickens
to her as a birthday present, and
she loved them very much.

##
"Take those dirty scruffy chickens
out of here Mary!" shouted her
mother, "I don't want them
anywhere near this wedding tent."

##
Mary shooed her chickens out of the
tent.
"Run away you silly things." she
said, "I don't want you to be eaten
at John and Patience's wedding!"

##
"Mme says that this is going to be the best wedding
ever seen in Buchanan," Mary told her chickens, "and
she says that I can help all the older girls with the
cooking."
The chickens paid no attention to her.
"Mary!" called her mother from inside, "leave those
chickens of yours and come and help me with these
pots please!"

##
Mary's mother was very proud of her house, and wanted it to be
perfect for the wedding. She cleaned and washed and scrubbed
and scoured and polished everything in sight. When she had
finished, there was not a single speck of dust anywhere.
The chickens poked their heads inside the front door. "Out!"
shouted Mary's mother, "out you scruffy things with your dirty feet
and beaks!"

##
Mary followed her chickens out into the yard.
"Mama is right, you are a disgrace," she scolded
them
So Mary thought for a while. Suddenly she smiled
and said to herself, "I have an excellent idea."
She went and filled a bucket with water from the
spring.
Mary had a lot of trouble catching her chickens. They
did not think that a bath was such a good idea.

##
Mary put the first chicken into the
bucket of water.
It clucked at the top of its voice and
flapped its wings like crazy.
"Hold still you silly thing," Mary
shouted, "this won't take long!"
When Mary wiped the chicken's
nose and eyes it suddenly went
limp and
flopped over the side of the bucket.

##
"This is no time to sleep," said Mary.
She gave it a good shake to get all
the water out.
"If you are not going to wake up
now, I'll have to put you somewhere
to dry nicely," she said. She laid the
chicken out on the grass to dry.
The chicken lay completely still.

##
Mary washed each and every one of her chickens.
Each and every one of them went limp and floppy
before she was finished with it.
She put all those eight chickens in a row on the grass
to dry.
Not one of them moved a single feather.
"I'll leave them to sleep a little," Mary thought to
herself, and off she went to check on the collard
greens.

##
Mrs. Teeweh and Mrs. Beh were
Mary's aunts. They did not like each
other at all.
The aunts had been preparing for
months for Patience's wedding, but
they would not even think about
riding together in the same taxi.

##
Mrs. Teeweh spotted Mary's chickens laid out to dry.
"What a nice little snack for me to take home!" she
said to herself.
She took off her shawl and carefully wrapped all
those chickens up in it.
Not a single chicken moved.
"Perfect!" she smiled, "now I shall put them
somewhere where Mrs. Beh will not ever find them,"
and she put the bundle around the corner among the
pumpkin vines.

##
Mrs. Beh decided to make her famous bitter balls dish. She took
her big bowl and went off to the vegetable garden.
In the vegetable garden she saw Mrs. Teeweh's bundle under the
pumpkin vine. She undid the bundle.
Out fell all eight chickens. "Eish!" she cried jumping back in
surprise.
"Oh, you are the cleanest, prettiest chickens! Just ready for my
pot," she crooned.
"Now, where shall I hide you my darlings?" Mrs. Beh chuckled, "I'll
have to find a very good place," she said walking round the house.
"I know," she said at last, "I'll put you on the roof!"
Mrs. Beh climbed up onto the garden wall and put the chickens in
a row on the thatched roof.

##
The next day the sun rose in good time for the wedding. Mary was
up first and went to see her chickens.
She saw that they were no longer lying on the grass.
"They must be nicely dry by now. I'm sure they have gone to look
for their breakfast," she said.

##
Patience's wedding was wonderful.
Those chickens did not get up off the roof to join in
when all the bridesmaid ladies danced into the yard.
Not one of the chickens stirred when the church choir
sang in their loudest, sweetest voices.
The chickens were still lying on the roof when the
priest gave his sermon.
They did not even twitch a feather when the pigs and
Mary's grandfather all snored loudly in the middle of
the sermon.
Not one foot of those chickens trembled when sheep
wandered into the tent, nearly knocking over the
wedding cake.

##
It was only when the groom's father
was halfway through his speech
that things started to change on
that roof.

##
The first chicken spread its wings and flew onto Mrs. Teeweh's
bosom. Mrs. Beh next to her started giggling.
Another chicken flew up onto Mrs, Teeweh's new dress. The people
at the next table tried not to laugh.
The lady next to Mrs. Teeweh put her head down onto the table,
"Ai, aai, aaaaii, he, he, heeeeeeee!" she cackled.
All the other chickens decided to join the first two. You couldn't see
Mrs. Teeweh for all those chickens!

##
The guests screamed with laughter.
The men had to hold onto their bellies.
The women rolled around in their chairs.
The boys and girls were hanging onto each other.
The grandmothers could hardly breathe for laughing.
The grandfathers stamped their walking sticks.
Then the two aunts looked at each other and started giggling. Mrs.
Beh opened her mouth wide with laughter. Mrs. Teeweh threw back
her head and laughed until all her chins shook.
Mary couldn't believe it!

##
All the guests agreed that it was the best wedding entertainment
ever known in Buchanan.
"Oh you are so lucky!" Mary said to her chickens as she put them
into their coop for the night, "Mama says that she will never put
you in the supper pot."
"But look how dirty you are again," she told them, "I think I'll have
to give you another wash tomorrow!"
