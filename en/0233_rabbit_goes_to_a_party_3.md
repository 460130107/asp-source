# Rabbit Goes to a Party

##
Once upon a time, the
animals decided to
have a party. But it was
not for all of them. It
was only for the
animals that had horns.

##
The rabbit was getting
ready for the party. But
then he found out that
the party was not for
everyone. It was just for
animals with horns.

##
The rabbit went
somewhere and got
some horns. Then he
put them on his head
and went to the party.

##
During the party the
rabbit ate and drank
and danced.

##
This made him tired
and he fell down in the
sun. But while the
rabbit was sleeping, the
horns fell off!

##
Then all the animals
discovered that the
rabbit was not the kind
of animal they wanted.
So they pulled his ears
till they got bigger and
bigger.

##
Then they ran away.
And that's the reason
why rabbits have big
ears!
