# The Cooking Game

##
Once upon a time, the
rabbit and the monkey
were friends.
One day, in a time of
famine, the rabbit
invited his friend over
to play.

##
The rabbit said:Let's
play cooking each
other!
The monkey asked:
How can we do that?

##
And the rabbit
answered: We have to
make a fire,

##
and fill a pot with
water,and then put it on
the fire.

##
I will get in first.
When I beat on the lid
of the pot, you open it.
Then I will get out.
And the monkey
agreed.

##
So the rabbit got in
the pot first, and the
water started to warm
up.

##
The rabbit knocked, and
the monkey opened the
lid.

##
But when it was the
monkey's turn, the
rabbit took a big stone
and put it on the lid of
the pot and sat on top
of it!

##
When the water started
to boil, the monkey
knocked, but the rabbit
didn't open the lid.

##
So the monkey died,
and the rabbit ate his
best friend!
