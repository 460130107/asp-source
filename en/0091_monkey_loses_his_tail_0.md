# Monkey loses his tail

##
Hare and Monkey were great
friends.
They did everything together.


##
One day Hare said, "Let us go
and look for food."
Monkey accepted without
knowing what was waiting for
him!


##
They went into some people's
farm and began to eat maize.
Hare had been jealous of
Monkey because of his long tail.
He had planned to make
Monkey look foolish.


##
Hare had talked to the owners
of the maize about Monkey.
"Monkey will come to eat your
maize today. Teach him a
lesson!"


##
When they were eating the
maize, Hare hid and began
shouting, "Thief! Thief! Your
maize is being eaten!"
After that, he ran away.
Monkey did not know what was
going on.


##
Suddenly, the owners arrived
and found Monkey trying to run
away.
He did not get far because of
his long tail.


##
They shouted, "Stop! Stop! You
have eaten all our maize."
Monkey kept running hoping to
get away.


##
The owners caught him and
started beating him.
Monkey tried hard to escape
but he was unable to.


##
Monkey could not put up with
the pain any more.He begged
the owners to let him explain
what had happened.
"I was with my friend Hare. He
is the one who invited me," he
cried.


##
They did not listen to Monkey.
One of them took out a sharp
machete saying, "This is the
day we were waiting for! We will
teach you a lesson!"
He cut off Monkey's tail.
Hare saw where the tail was
thrown so he hid it.


##
After the owners left, Monkey
ran to escape more beating.
Meanwhile, Hare took Monkey's
tail to go and cook it.
"I will then invite Monkey for
lunch," he smiled.


##
After the meal, Monkey said,
"Thank you my friend for
serving such a delicious meal."
Hare asked Monkey if he knew
what he had eaten. Monkey
answered, "No, I don't."


##
Hare said, "That delicious meal
that you have just eaten, is
your tail."
After saying that, he ran away.
From that day, the two became
enemies!
