# Greedy Mairu

##
Once upon a time, there lived a man
called Mairu in Bubaali Village.He
liked to eat meat so much.

##
One day, the chairman of Bubaali
village invited all the villagers to his
wedding that was to take place at
his home.

##
Then Mairu also heard that there
was another wedding in Nabuyanja
village.
“Ugh! ugh! ugh!Two parties on the
same day!” Mairu imagined.

##
“I must attend both parties,” ha ha
ha said. “I will first walk to Bubaali
then come back to Nabuyanja.”

##
Mairu woke up very early in the
morning and walked to Bubaali
village. He looked around and saw
that the party had not yet started.
“I will go back to Nabuyanja and
return to Bubaali later,” Mairu
suggested to him self, yes! yes!
hope i will not be late.

##
Mairu walked gently back to Bubaali
hoping to find the meat ,rice,sodas
and matooke ready. He was now
very hungry. When he arrived, men
and women were still preparing the
food.

##
“I left cooks at Bubaali preparing to
cook,” he thought. “The food must
be ready now.” Mairu decided to
walk back to Nabuyanja under hot
sunshine , i will not loose hope he
added!

##
Mairu arrived at the Bubaali party,
people had already eaten and
cleaned the utensils. Guests were
giving presents to the bride and the
groom. Mairu was very
disappointed. he looked displaced
and every one became concerned.
but his target was to eat enough .

##
. He decided to walk back to
Nabuyanja village. Because he was
hungry and tired, he could not walk
fast any more.

##
When he arrived at Nabuyanja
village, the food was over and it
was time for the bride and groom
giving a speech.

##
Upon hearing that there was no
food, Mairu fell and fainted. He had
missed meat from both parties. All
he got was some posho and beans
on a small plate yet his target was
to eat meat.

##
gently ,he walked back home
cursing never to serve two masters
at ago.
