# Sly jackal tricks the silly donkey

##
Once upon a time, sly jackal woke
up early in the morning. He was
very hungry. His tummy gave a big
growl. GRRrrrrr! He jumped up and
went searching for food.

##
He wandered around the forest for
hours without getting any food. The
sun was very hot. Sly jackal could
barely see in front of him. All he
could think of was his hunger
pangs.

##
“Aaauuuu!” Sly jackal let out a loud
scream. He fell into a well right in
front of him. He was so hungry that
he did not spot it.

##
“Oh my hat!” he thought. “I have to
get out of this well. I will die of
hunger.”

##
Sly jackal screamed and shouted:
“Help! Anyone help!” Donkey was
grazing a few metres away from the
well. Donkey heard sly jackal's
desperate cry. He came rushing.

##
“What is the matter?” Donkey was
very worried.
“The water in this well is cool and
sweet. I am bored swimming alone.
I need someone to help me swim.
Please will you join me?”

##
“The sun is very hot,” said donkey.
“I can't swim very well though.”
“Jump in! I will help you come out of
the well,” promised the sly jackal.

##
Donkey jumped into the well. The
water was so cool. He was free from
the heat. Before he knew it, the sly
jackal had jumped on his back and
out of the well. Sly jackal laughed
and ran away. Donkey was trapped
in the well. He started screaming
and shouting: “Help! Anyone help!”
