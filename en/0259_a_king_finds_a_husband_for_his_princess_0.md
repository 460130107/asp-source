# A King Finds a Husband for His Princess

##
Once upon a time, there lived a
king called Opale with his beautiful
queen.
They had only one beautiful
daughter.

##
One day, a king looked at his
princess and said to his wife, "I
think our daughter is grown up now,
we must find her a handsome man
from the village."

##
"Who will marry my beautiful
princess?, a king asked himself.
He thought of a test for all men who
will come expecting to marry his
daughter.
"I am going to cook a pot full
of water and any man who will drink
this hot water will marry my lovely
daughter." said the king.

##
The following day the king put up an announcement
inviting all unmarried men in the village.

Announcement!!! Announcement!!!
To all young and unmarried men in the village,a king
wants to find a handsome man for his beautiful
daughter.
Come, Come, Come all.

##
On hearing the announcement,all young men were
very excited and every body got set for the day.

##
One of the young men told his
father,I have had that the king has
invited all young men to his
palace,he wants to choose a
husband for his daughter.
Father,"I must go and stand before
the king,am very sure I will come
back with the princess."

##
As usual,it was a proposed day,a
queue of young and smartly
dressed men was seen moving
towards the palace.
Every body was very happy.

##
"You are all most welcome"said the
king.
Then the king began to address the
crowd of young men,If any one
drinks a pot of hot water all at
once,he will be able to my lovely
princess with him.

##
They were very many in that the
interview could not be complete
within a day.
Most men tried their level best but
they could not go with the princess.

##
On the following day,there came
mr. Hare who had heard the
announcement late.
He was welcomed and given a seat.

##
The king told him,to take my
daughter,one has got to drink a pot
of hot water all at once.
That is nothing to me,my lord,said
mr Hare.

##
Mr. Hare was a very wise and tricky
man,he started a very interesting
story that took up the king's
attention while the water was
cooling.

##
The chiefs and the king were very
happy saying, "This is the man we
wanted."
In a few minutes,the hot water had
cooled and mr. Hare drank it all at
once.

##
The king and his chiefs were very
surprised to see mr. Hare drinking
the hot water.

##
Finally mr. Hare took the beautiful
princess with him and he was very
happy but the king remained very
sad because his daughter had gone
with an animal.
