# The Hornbill

##
As I was moving in
Buŋaanga village I
found a fat hornbill.

##
When I struck it with a
catapult, it shouted
"ŋaa, ŋaa, ŋa!"

##
The hornbill flew into
the air.
But I ran after it
through the grass...

##
...until it perched on a
dead tree.
Then I shot it again.
This time it fell to the
ground.

##
I picked up the hornbill.

##
And I gave it to
Hiryagaana: one who
eats whatever he finds.
(One time, I gave him
Namupongera.)
He happily received the
hornbill.

##
The head of the hornbill
was very big and as
hard as a panga or
machete.

##
The bird had fat like
that of a sheep.
It was so appetising!

##
It's not easy to find a
hornbill without
planning.
At night, hornbills roost
on dry branches.
A person eats what he
likes.
That is why Hiryagaana
eats hornbills.
