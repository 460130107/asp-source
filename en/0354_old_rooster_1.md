# Old rooster

##
Once upon a time there was an old
woman who lived alone. She had
many chickens. Among them was a
rooster that was very old and could
no longer crow.

##
One day the old woman's grandson
visited. She was very happy to see
him. She asked the young man to
catch the old rooster so they could
cook and eat it.

##
The old rooster heard the woman
talking and its heart sank.
“Aaiii, you are also very old but I
don't see anyone trying to kill you,
we will see!”
So the old rooster sneaked away
and decided to head for the big city
to start singing.

##
As the old rooster walked, he met
the cat.
“What has happened?” the cat
asked.
“My friend, my boss wants to eat
me because I can no longer tell her
the time,” said the old rooster.
“I am going to the big city to sing.
Where are you going?”
“My friend, my boss has also
decided to kill me because I can no
longer catch rats. I am running
away,” said the cat. “Can I join
you?”
“Let's go!” said the old rooster.

##
They had walked a short while when
they saw a dog running very fast.
The old rooster called the dog and
asked why he was running so fast.
“My friend, my boss chased me
because I can no longer catch
thieves,” replied the dog while
panting.
“We have similar problems. We are
going to the big city to sing,” said
the old rooster.
“Can I join you?” asked the dog.

##
The three animals set off together.
As they were walking, a horse
stopped them and asked what was
happening.
“Our bosses want to kill us because
we can no longer do our jobs,” they
all replied together.
“I have the same problem, where
are you going?” asked the horse.
“We are going to the big city to
sing,” they replied.
The horse asked to join them and
they accepted.

##
They all walked until it was dark.
They saw a house and when they
reached it they heard noises inside.
They were afraid and decided to
sing a song to chase away the
people who were in the house.
The horse stood on the ground, the
dog climbed onto the horse's back,
the cat climbed on the dog's back,
and the rooster climbed on the cat's
back.

##
They immediately started singing.
“Kookoliookoo,” sang the rooster.
“Myaaawuu myaaawuu,” sang the
cat.
“Woo woo,” sang the dog.
“Wuuuu wuuuu,” sang the horse.
They all sang loudly together. The
people inside the house were
thieves. The thieves were afraid and
ran away.

##
The old rooster, the dog, the horse
and the cat entered the house and
found food. When they had finished
eating they went to sleep. The
rooster slept near the door, followed
by the cat, the dog, and lastly the
horse.

##
It was not too long before the
thieves were back. Their boss was
the first to go into the house. He
had just opened the door when the
old rooster pecked him with its
beak.
Then the cat scratched him with its
nails. And then he found the dog,
which bit him.

##
The man jumped but continued into
the house. He found the horse,
which kicked him to death. The
other thieves did not enter the
house. They ran away, never to
return.

##
The animals lived happily ever after
in that house. The old rooster told
the time to his friends, and the dog
kept them safe. The cat killed all
the rats in the house, and the horse
carried them on its back wherever
they wanted to go.
