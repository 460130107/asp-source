# Akai's special mat

##
When Akai was a little girl, her
mother used to put her to sleep
on a beautiful mat.
Akai's aunt made this special
mat from palm leaves.

##
The mat had bright pink, blue
and green colours.
It was different from other mats
that Akai's mother had in the
hut.

##
The land around Akai's home
was very dry, hot and full of
stones.
There were many scorpions,
spiders and snakes too.

##
But Akai was never in danger of
being bitten by these
dangerous creatures.
Her mother said, “Her special
mat protects Akai from any
harm.”

##
Akai was a clever child.
She discovered where the
nearest shallow well was.

##
She also knew where her
grandmother's manyatta was
located.
She often went to enjoy
drinking camel milk with her
grandmother.

##
One day, Akai was not so lucky.
She left to go to her
grandmother's manyatta, but
she did not get there.
She got lost in the hills.
Akai was afraid.

##
She sat under an edome tree
and waited for help.
Soon she fell asleep and had a
dream.

##
This is how the dream went:
She was lying on her special
mat.
A woman who looked like her
grandmother was watching over
her.
The lady smiled and gave her a
big bowl of camel milk.
Just when Akai stretched out
her hand to take the milk, she
woke up.

##
Akai opened her eyes slowly.
When she looked up, she saw a
small blue bird standing on a
branch above her.

##
When Akai got up, the small
blue bird flapped its wings and
led the way for Akai.
She followed the bird.

##
Akai came to a place where the
path went in two different
directions.
The blue bird dropped a piece
of a mat that was like Akai's
own mat.

##
Picking up the piece of mat,
Akai saw footprints that she
knew were her mother's.
Soon she saw the shallow well
from where they fetched water.

##
Akai's family sang and danced
to welcome her home.
They slaughtered a goat,
roasted the meat and
celebrated their child's safe
return.

##
Akai sat on her special mat and
enjoyed eating a big piece of
roast meat.
