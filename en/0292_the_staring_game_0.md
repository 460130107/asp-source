# The Staring Game

##
A long time ago, the
rabbit and the snake
were good friends.

##
One day they began to
chat with each other.
But the rabbit was
much cleverer than the
snake, and the snake
knew it!

##
So, they were
discussing who could
stare the longest. The
snake said:
Let's try it. I will win by
staring at you.
So the rabbit agreed to
the staring game.

##
The snake and the
rabbit began to stare.
They kept on doing it
for several minutes.

##
Then the snake got
tired. So he got out of
his body and only his
skin was left looking at
the rabbit.

##
The rabbit continued
looking at the snake's
skin for several hours.

##
The rabbit thought he
was the cleverest
animal, but on that day,
his cleverness was
ended. And that's why
to this day the rabbit
sleeps with his eyes
open!
