# Lazy Anansi

##
Once upon a time, there was a
spider called Anansi.
He was too lazy to cook his own
food. Instead, he used to visit his
friends and eat the delicious food
they had cooked.

##
One day, he was walking past
Rabbit's house when he smelled
something cooking.
“Greens!” he said excitedly.
“They're not quite ready yet,” said
Rabbit. “You can help me with the
washing up in the mean time.”
“Sorry, I have things to do. I'll come
back later,” said Anansi.

##
“How will I call you when they're
ready?” asked Rabbit.
Anansi thought for a minute.
“I'll spin a web,” he said, “and tie
one end around my leg and one end
to your pot. When the greens are
ready, pull on the web string and I'll
come right away.”
So Anansi tied the web to the pot,
and walked on.

##
A short while later he saw Monkey
and his wife, cooking some beans in
a large pot.
“Come and join us!” they said. “The
beans are nearly ready.”
“Sorry, I have things to do,” said
Anansi before they could ask him to
help.
“But let me tie one end of this web
around my leg and one end to your
pot. When the beans are ready, pull
on the web string, and I'll come.”

##
He walked on until he smelled
sweet potatoes.
“Anansi,” called his friend Warthog.
“My pot is full of sweet potatoes
and honey! Come and share my
food with me. Here's a fork for you
to help me stir.”
“I'll come back later,” said Anansi
quickly. “But let me tie one end of
this web around my leg and one
end to your pot. When the sweet
potatoes are ready, pull on the web
string, and I'll come.”

##
By the time Anansi arrived at the
river, each of his eight legs was tied
to a different pot of delicious food.
Just then, Anansi felt a tug on one
of his legs.
“Rabbit's food is ready!” he said,
licking his lips.

##
He felt a second tug.
And a third.
And a fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh,
eighth...
Everyone was pulling on the web
strings at the same time!
“Stop! Stop!” he cried in pain, as
his legs were stretched thinner and
thinner.
But no one could hear him.

##
Finally, the web strings could hold
no longer. They snapped one by
one.
Anansi rolled into the river to
soothe his painful legs. But his legs
would not return to their normal
shape.
And he was too embarrassed to go
to any of his friends and share their
food that day.
