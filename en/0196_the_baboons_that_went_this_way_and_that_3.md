# The baboons that went this way and that

##
The people in a village of small
huts were becoming unhappy.
Wild animals began to come
and frighten them.

##
These animals ate all their
crops and even carried children
away.
It was not a good place to live
any longer, but where could the
people go?

##
One family found the answer.
It was not hard to find food up
in the hills.

##
Bushes grew in the cracks
between rocks.
Trees grew on the slopes of the
hills.
The parents trapped rock
rabbits and the children caught
birds.

##
Other families noticed how well
the hill family lived.
“It is a good life up in the hills,”
said the husband. “You should
come there too.”

##
Soon the other families left the
flat land and went up to the
hills.
Each family found a cave to live
in, and felt warm and secure.

##
Soon the children became very
quick at climbing rocks, and
finding fruit in the trees.
They could swing in the
branches almost as well as any
monkey.

##
Slowly, things began to change.
The children talked less, and
grunted more. Then the adults
noticed that their noses were
getting bigger and that they
were growing more hair.

##
Every time they looked at one
another they saw that their
teeth were longer.
They started to walk on four
legs.

##
They became a new creature
that no-one had seen before in
that place. This was the
creature which people now call
the baboon.

##
For a time, the baboons lived
happily. They stopped chasing
the rock rabbits and ate grubs
from the ground.

##
They forgot how to talk. They took off their clothes because
their legs and arms were covered with dark hair.

##
They still remembered that they
had been people. They looked
at each other's big noses and
laughed at each other.

##
But they did not like the
laughing. They jumped up and
down in anger.
Soon the baboons could not be
together because of the
laughing and the anger. Each
family went off and lived by
itself.

##
That is why baboons live in small groups today and do not live as a baboon
nation.
