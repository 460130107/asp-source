Imagine a day.... when
everyone knows how to
read and there are
books in every
language.

Imagine a day.... when i gave birth to my first baby.

Imagine a day.... when all people in the world would live
peacefully as brothers and sisters.

Imagine a day.... when I can walk
on water.

Imagine a day.... when
your daughter became
a president.

Imagine a day..... when you are about to be put in a grave
and then you came back to life again.

Imagine a day.... when people
develop wings, fly and reach where
the creator is.

##
Imagine a day.... when all the ground is covered with a
carpet in the whole world.
