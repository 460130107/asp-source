# The rainbow

##
I love the rainbow

##
I love all the colours of
the rainbow.

##
I wish I could have a
rainbow house

##
It could have a red roof.

##
It could have a blue
windows.

##
I could have it painted yellow
outside.

##
It could have violet
walls inside.

##
It could have orange
flowers.

##
It could have indigo bed.

##
It could have a green
garden.
