# Teacher Akinyi

##
This is my teacher.
Her name is Teacher
Akinyi.
She loves me a lot.

##
Teacher Akinyi teaches
us the alphabet and the
vowels.
I can say the letters a,
e, i, o, u.

##
Teacher Akinyi has
taught us the colours
red, blue, green, yellow,
and black.

##
During nap time
Teacher Akinyi sings us
to sleep.
She sings a lullaby to
us.

##
The lullaby goes like this:
Golden slumber give your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darlings, do not cry
And I'll sing you a sweet lullaby.

##
Teacher Akinyi knows many stories.
She tells us a different story each day of the
week.

##
On Monday, she tells us
stories about great
men.

##
On Tuesday, she tells us
stories about great
women.

##
On Wednesday, she
tells us stories about
means of transport.

##
On Thursday, she tells
us stories about
farming.

##
And on Friday, Teacher
Akinyi asks us to tell
our own stories to the
class.

##
Our teacher is the best
teacher in the world!
When I grow up, I want
to be like Teacher
Akinyi.
