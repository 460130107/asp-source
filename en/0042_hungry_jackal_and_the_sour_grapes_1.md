# Hungry jackal and the sour grapes

##
Once upon a time there was a
hungry jackal. He was walking
around the bush looking for
food.

##
He came upon a big orchard of
fresh ripe grapes. He spotted a
bunch of grapes hanging from a
high branch.

##
"Those look really delicious," he
thought to himself.? He took a
few steps back so that he could
make his highest jump.

##
The grapes were too high.
Jackal fell on his back without
getting to the grapes.

##
Jackal got up and went further
back from his starting spot. This
time he was planning to jump
higher. He almost got high
enough but he fell harder on his
back.

##
He tried again and again, but
couldn't get to the grapes. He
kept falling until his back was
very sore.

##
Finally, he gave up and walked
away.

##
Jackal was not happy at all. He
stopped, looked back at the
grapes and thought, "Those
grapes look really sour anyway."
He carried on walking. He was
hungrier than before.
