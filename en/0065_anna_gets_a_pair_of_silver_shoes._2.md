DRESSING UP.
Mum, mum l am going to participate in a
play at school,“ Can l have your best hat for
the play?” said Anna.

Can I have your new dress?
No you can not, said Mum.
It is too big for you to wear and l want to
wear it, said Mum.

Anna cried and cried
I want a hat, or a dress, or a red coat, she
said.
Mum was cross
Your are very silly, said Mum.
I have told you Anna.
You can not have my hat, or a dress, or a red
coat.
Now it is bedtime.

Well, can l have your new red coat? Said
Anna.
Don't be silly, said her Mum
I will think of something you can take.

##
The next morning Anna ran down for
breakfast.
Have you got something for me Mum? Said
Anna.
Yes.
It is in this box.
You can open it at school.

Anna went to school
She took the box with her.
It was too small to have a dress in it.
It was too big to have a hat in it.

I have got my Grandmother dress, said
Emma
I have got my Mum's old coat, said Billy
That is good, said Miss Jones
What have you brought Anna?

Hello children, said Miss Jones.
Have you got something to wear in the play?
.I have got my Dad's hat, said Peter

##
I do not know.
My mum gave me this box
She gave the box to Miss Jones
Miss Jones took off the lid of the box

The children all wanted to see what was
inside the box
Look, said Miss Jones
It is a pair of silver shoes.
Ooooh,said the children.

##
We can act a very good play now.
We act Cinderella and the silver slippers, said Miss Jones
And you can be Cinderella, Anna
Then all the children clapped and Anna was very happy.
