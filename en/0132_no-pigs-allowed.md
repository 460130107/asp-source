# No pigs allowed

##
Years ago, a group of horned
animals decided to have a big
party high up in the mountains.
They only invited other animals
with horns. No one else.

##
When the pig heard about the
party, he thought, "I don't have
horns. What am I going to do?"

##
The next day, he had an idea.
He'd stick some horns to his
head with wax!

##
It worked and the pig felt very
clever when he was allowed
into the party. The problem was
that the party was taking place
close to the sun.

##
When the party started heating
up, the wax began to melt and
his horns fell off.
The horned animals were
shocked. "Who's that one with
no horns? Why did he come
here?" they asked.

##
The king of the animals
commanded, "Grab that pig and
throw him down to earth."
They grabbed the pig and threw
him down to earth.

##
Poor pig! When he fell, he
landed on his nose. And his
nose was flattened into a snout.

##
So don't be surprised when you
see the pig's flat snout,
because it's been that way ever
since.
