# Namukuru’s bicycle

##
Namukuru and her
brother are ready
for school.

##
Namukuru carries
her brother on
her bicycle.

##
Their friends cheer
for them as they
ride into school.

##
While they are
in the classroom,
a monkey arrives
outside.
The monkey
rides away on
Namukuru’s bicycle!

##
The children chase
the monkey.

##
The monkey leaves
the bicycle under
a tree.

##
The monkey swims
to an island in the
middle of the lake.
He climbs high into
a tree.

##
The monkey waves
goodbye!
The children wave back.
Namukuru has her
bicycle again.
