# Fire's story

##
Let me tell you my
story.
I start as a small spark.

##
I run wild when the
wind carries me.

##
We are good friends,
you and I.

##
I cook your food.

##
I light your night.

##
I have many tricks.

##
I am part of your family.

##
But be careful when
you invite me to your
home.
I don't like to be left
alone.
