# Kalabushe the talkative

##
Long time ago there lived a girl
whose name was Kalabushe.
Kalabushe was a very talkative
girl. Kalabushe's mother warned
her not to talk too much, but
Kalabushe did not listen.

##
One day, Kalabushe's aunt fell
sick. She lived across the valley
on the other side of Kalabushe's
village.

##
Kalabushe's mother was very
busy that day. It was late in the
evening by the time she gave
Kalabushe food to take to her
sick aunt.

##
On the way Kalabushe met
Sinson, the hyena who had
changed into a person.

##
Sinson asked her what she was
carrying. Kalabushe answered,
“Meat, eggs and milk.”
Kalabushe's mother had warned
her not to say what she was
carrying.

##
Kalabushe also told Sinson that
her aunt was sick and that she
was taking the food to her.
Sinson began salivating at the
thought of the meat that
Kalabushe was carrying.

##
He quickly ran ahead of
Kalabushe to her aunt's house.

##
He swallowed Kalabushe's aunt
and then covered himself with
her blanket.

##
When Kalabushe arrived, the
house was very quiet. She went
inside the house and called out,
“Aunt, where are you?”

##
When she did not hear her
aunt's voice, Kalabushe went to
the inner room where her aunt
slept. She was surprised when
she saw someone covered with
a big blanket.

##
“Aunt, why are your ears so big
today?” asked Kalabushe.
Sinson replied from under the
big blanket, “So that I can hear
you well.”

##
Kalabushe asked again, “Aunt,
why are your eyes so big
today?”
Sinson answered, “So I can see
you well.”

##
Kalabushe finally asked, “Aunt,
why is your mouth so big
today?”
Sinson replied, “So I can
swallow you up.”
Sinson jumped from the bed
and swallowed up Kalabushe.

##
Because Kalabushe was very
talkative, she kept talking even
when she was inside Sinson's
stomach. She asked many
questions.

##
In the end, Sinson was so tired
of Kalabushe's many questions
that he decided to spit her out.

##
Kalabushe and her aunt were
rescued by the villagers. From
that day, Kalabushe did not talk
too much to strangers.
