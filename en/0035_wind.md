# Wind

##
The wind roars.

It roars past our home.

##
The wind is powerful.

It tears my kite from my hand.

##
I run after my kite.

The wind blows me away from the kite!

##
The wind becomes a tornado.

It carries my kite higher and higher.

##
The tornado swallows me up!

I see nothing, I touch nothing.

##
Where is my kite now?

Perhaps it is caught in a tree.

##
Perhaps my kite is still flying in the sky.

##
The wind finally dies down.

I am still spinning.

##
When I stop spinning I look around.

Where did the wind go?

##
I cannot see my kite anywhere.

I cannot hear the wind anymore.

##
Perhaps tomorrow I will find my kite.

Now, I must go home, before the wind starts to roar again.
