# The bleeding apple

##
Kala was staying with his Mom.
They lived in a big house. Kala
was a spoiled boy. His Mom
loved him very much. He got
everything that he wanted.

##
It was a bright, sunny Saturday
morning. It was the start of the
school holidays. Kala woke up
later than usual. He was excited
and ready to go out in the
street to play with his friends.

##
Kala's Mom was working in her
vegetable garden. She saw her
son running out through the
door.

##
On the kitchen table there was
a big basket full of a variety of
fruits. Kala called out to his
Mom, asking for an apple. "Did
you bath?'' asked his Mom. "Did
you brush your teeth?" she
asked too. "Yes Mom!"
answered Kala. "Ok, you can
have one," she agreed.

##
Kala immediately chose the biggest, juiciest
apple from the fruit basket. He then dashed
outside towards his favourite playing area.

##
After a few seconds, Mom heard
Kala screaming. "Aah, Mom!"
called Kala.

##
"Mom, my apple is bleeding!" he said. His Mom was busy in
the kitchen and Kala burst through the door. "Why are you
making such a noise Kala," asked his Mom. "What is it?"

##
"My apple is bleeding, look," he said again.
Kala's Mom stopped what she was doing and
turned to look at her son. She had a surprise
look on her face.

##
She took the apple from Kala's hand and looked at it.
"Come here and open your mouth," she order Kala. "Aah,"
opened Kala wide. Mom bend a little and peeped into her
son's mouth.

##
"It's not the apple that is bleeding, you little, lazy, naughty boy. It's your filthy,
yellow rotting teeth!" she shouted. "You do not brush your teeth as told!" she said
with a cross face. All that Kala felt as he escaped through the door, was his
behind getting warm from his Mom's dish cloth!
