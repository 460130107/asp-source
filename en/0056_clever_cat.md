# Clever cat

##
In my village lives
Mister Kiio.
Mister Kiio has a cat
with black and white
spots called Safi.

##
When Mister Kiio goes
to work, he leaves the
door open.

##
Safi sits in the doorway
to watch over Mister
Kiio's house.

##
When the neighbour's
dog comes close, Safi
stares at him and
shows her nails.

##
The dog runs away.

##
When a neighbour
appears, Safi is ready to
scratch.

##
The neighbour turns
and runs away.

##
When Safi feels hungry,
she pushes the door
and then closes it with
her paws.

##
She goes inside and
eats her food.

##
When Safi finishes, she
jumps onto the sofa and
sleeps. All you hear is,
“Purr! Purr! Purr!”

##
When Mister Kiio
arrives, Safi stretches
happily and welcomes
him home.

##
Mister Kiio and Safi sit
down next to the
fireplace and each
reads the newspaper.
