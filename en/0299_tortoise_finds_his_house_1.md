# Tortoise finds his house

##
One day Tortoise was walking through the veld. He was looking and looking. He
gazed into the distance and squinted at the grass.
Then he went past Snail.

##
“Are you looking for something?” Snail asked.
“Yes, Snail, I'm looking for my house. Have you
seen it, by any chance?”

##
Snail said: “No, I haven't, but I'll help you look!”
She climbed onto Tortoise's shell. Tortoise walked on with Snail on his back. They
looked and looked, but there was no sign of a house. The sun was high in the sky.

##
A little later they passed Sparrow.
“Are you looking for something?” asked Sparrow.
“Yes, Sparrow, I'm looking for my house. Have you seen it, by any chance?”
Sparrow said: “No, I haven't, but I'll help you look!”

##
He flapped his wings and he
whizzed away.
“But you're going too fast for
me,” complained
Tortoise.
Sparrow came back. “Alright,
then I'll hop on too.”

##
Tortoise carried on, with Snail
and Sparrow perched
on his shell. They looked and
looked, but there was
no sign of a house. The sun had
inched lower in the
sky.

##
A little later they passed Ladybird.
“Are you looking for something?” asked Ladybird.
“Yes, Ladybird, I'm looking for my house. Have you seen it, by any chance?”

##
Ladybird said: “No, I haven't,
but I'll help you look!”
She hopped onto Tortoise's
back and on he went,
with Snail and Sparrow and
Ladybird sitting on his
back.
They looked and looked, but
there was no sign of a
house. A breeze started to blow.

##
A little later they passed Mouse. He was making a garland of daisies.
“Are you looking for something?” asked Mouse.
“Yes, Mouse, I'm looking for my house. Have you seen it, by any chance?”

##
Mouse said: “No, I haven't, but
I'll help you look!”
He hopped onto Tortoise's back.
“Wait, I can't leave my flowers
behind.” Tortoise waited. Mouse
stretched and stretched and
scooped up his daisies.

##
Tortoise walked on, with Snail
and Sparrow and
Ladybird and Mouse on his
back. They looked and looked,
but there was no sign of a
house. The wind swept leaves
off the ground and swirled them
around Tortoise's feet.
Tortoise got tired. “You lot are
heavy,” he sighed.

##
The wind got stronger. The sky
turned dark.
“Oh, where is my house?” asked
Tortoise.
Thunder roared in the hills.
Lightning flashed in the
distance. Drip-drip came the
rain.
“Oh, where is Tortoise's house?”
asked Snail and Sparrow and
Ladybird and Mouse.

##
The wind whirled and whipped. It
blew Snail and Sparrow and Ladybird and Mouse right off Tortoise's back.

##
And then came the hail, tip-tip-tip.
Tortoise got such a fright he shrank into his shell. It was warm and cosy there.
“Oh, here is my house!”

##
“Oh, here is Tortoise's house!”
