# First man and first woman

##
Long long ago when the earth was new,
great mountains covered the world like a
blanket, and tall trees spiked the sky.

##
In this world, there was a deep dark pool, silent
and cold.

##
At the bottom of this pool were
two snakes.
One had thick strongly
patterned coils, and the other
was smaller and more delicate.

##
Then one day, there was a great storm.
A flash of lightning pierced right to the bottom
of the pool.
The waters parted for a moment.
The snakes saw the earth above, full of colours
and shapes and feathered creatures.
When the waters closed again, the snakes
could not forget the beauty they had seen.

##
“We cannot stay in this dark cold pool any longer,” they said to each other.
“Let us go up and see the earth above.”
“How will we live on earth?” said the smaller snake.
“Will we crawl on our bellies?”

##
“The birds of the air will not laugh at us for
being so low,” said her friend.
“We will not crawl, we will walk!”
Very slowly the snakes uncoiled themselves.
Close together they began to swim up, up, to
the light above.

##
And as they reached the surface of the water,
a strange thing happened.
The tips of their tails split into two.
They grew limbs with feet and toes.
From just beneath their heads grew two arms
with hands and fingers.

##
They were no longer snakes, but Man and Woman.

##
“We will make our home in the
hills,” said Woman. “Each
morning we will see the sun rise
and feel it warm on our backs.”
“We will look after the grass
and the trees,” said Man. “And
be friends with Bird and Beast.”

##
“Come,” said First Man.
“I will,” said First Woman.
And they walked out together into their new world.
