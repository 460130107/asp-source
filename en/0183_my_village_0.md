# My village

##
In those days, there used to be bad behaved
people and I thank the president for setting
up a police station in our village. This police
station has helped us so much by arresting
those bad behaved people. I also thank this
police station because it saved my cousin
from killers. How did it save her? One day
when my cousin was going to the well to
fetch water, as she was almost reaching the
well, she had not noticed that the killers
were following her she heard a voice saying
that

Everyone should have a village where his or
her ancestors came from.
I come from Serere district, in my village,
there are different tribes and these are;
Baganda, Japadhola, Iteso etc. Baganda like
digging while us the Iteso like normadic
pastoralism.

"Stop there". Then she saw them with their weapons. she cried so
loud that the police heard her.
She saw the police officers coming. Then they arrested those
killers. That's how she was saved by the police.
I now like going to visit my relatives in the village. Whenever I go
to the village, my relatives welcome me warmly and our
grandparents tell us interesting stories.

THE END.
