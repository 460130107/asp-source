# Ms Phone

##
She is called Ms Phone. Look at her!

##
She has five cellphones.

When she wakes up, she arranges her cellphones on the table.

##
The yellow one is for communicating with family.

##
The white one is for communicating with people at work.

##
The red one is for communicating with those who owe her something.

##
The pink one is for communicating with her best friends.

##
The purple one is for communicating with people who need her help.

##
Ms Phone likes people to be happy. She does not like fighting.

##
She lets the children watch television at her shop.

##
She visits the sick and the elderly in their homes.

##
When she passes, there are shouts of “Ms Phone! Ms Phone!”

##
Then she feels happy and says, “I am Ms Phone. Here, look at my phones!”

That is Ms Phone and her five cellphones.
