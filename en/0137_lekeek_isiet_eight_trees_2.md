# Lekeek isiet! Eight trees

##
The children compete to name the different
types of trees and birds.

One child says, “Eight trees! “ [or birds, or
cows, or anything in sight that is countable]

##
The rest ask “Which are
these eight?”
Eight trees! Which are
these eight?

##
Eight birds! Which are
these eight?
Eight trees! Which are
these eight?
Eight cows!
Which are these eight?

##
Eight cows!

Which are these eight?

##
They also name these
according to colours.
Then first child has to
say the colours or
names of the eight
goats or cows.

##
What colour are the
eight goats?
The others answer,
“Eight white goats.”

##
The Il Chamus are the second smallest
community in Kenya.
The community lives around the shores of
Lake Baringo in Baringo County.
According to statistics, they number less
than 50,000 members.

##
They regard themselves as one of the
indigenous communities pushed to the area
by Maasai clan wars.
In fact, Il Chamus is a Maasai name meaning
people who can see into the future.
They were later renamed the Njemps by the
Europeans that is why today the Il Chamus
are often referred to as the Njemps.
They are part of the larger Nilotic group.
They are a pastoralist community.

##
Due to the nature of their lifestyle, the Il
Chamus' vocabulary revolves a lot around
livestock and trees. Livestock is the main
source of livelihood and trees are important
for constructing shelter and for pasture for
their animals.
For this reason, children are introduced to
colour and number of animals as well as
different types of trees found in their
environment.
This is done through a combination of short
stories and games.
