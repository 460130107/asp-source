# Our river, our life

##
Two small streams
formed River Temu. The
sheep, goats and deer
lived because of River
Temu.

##
But when Matata
became headman, he
cut down trees. He
made a path from the
top of the hill to the
bottom.

##
Matata's children and
their friends ran all over
the place. They broke
branches. They lit fires
and left them burning.

##
River Temu stopped flowing. The
deer went away. The sheep and
goats grew thinner and thinner.

##
The people chased away Matata,
the headman. They appointed
Baraka as the new leader. The
people were happy.

##
The path was closed
and grass grew once
again. River Temu was
revived. The land
became greener than
ever before.

##
People sang, “Long live
Baraka, long live
Baraka.” “May our
children and children's
children forever respect
River Temu.”
