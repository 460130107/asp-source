# WAMAŊE THE WEAK MAN

##
Once upon a time, there was a
weak man.

##
This man was called Wamaŋe.

##
Wamaŋe did not want to work at
all.

##
He was an idler.

##
Wamaŋe had no good clothes but
rugs.

##
This man had no hut to live in.

##
He slept outside at night and
watched the moon and stars as
they gave out light.

##
One day, it rained heavily

##
The night was very cold.

##
Wamaŋe felt very cold.
He started thinking of making a hut
for himself.

##
He sung,“Tomorrow I will build
myself a hut” ×4
In the morning when the sun
started shinning clearly,

##
Wamaŋe became warm. He
changed the song.
“It is hot why should I build a hut?”
×4
