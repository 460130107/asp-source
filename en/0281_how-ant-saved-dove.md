# How ant saved dove

##
It was a hot summer
day in the dry forest.

##
Little Ant had no water
for many days.

##
“I need a drop of water,
even if it falls from a
leaf.”

##
But even the dew had
dried up.

##
“If I don't drink, I will
die,” cried Little Ant.
“I must go to the river I
have heard about.”

##
“The river will sweep
you away,” a wise
squirrel warned him.

##
But Little Ant was so
thirsty.
“I will die if I don't drink
some water.”

##
Little Ant went to look
for the river...

##
across dry grass and
over dry branches...

##
...until he heard the
waves of the river
splashing.

##
Little Ant took a long
sip of cool water.

##
He was so happy he did
not see the huge wave
coming.

##
Ant tried to grab the
dry grass floating past
him.
But he was swept away
by the water.

##
“Help someone. Help
me please.”

##
“Quick, climb on,” said
White Dove, holding a
branch in his beak.

##

##
“I cannot leave until I
say thank you to the
dove. I will wait until he
comes back to drink.”

##
One day as he waited,
two boys came to the
river with their
slingshots.

##
“There is a big white
dove that comes here
to drink,” said one boy.
“We will have it for
supper tonight.”

##

##
“I cannot let the boys
kill White Dove.
But I am so tiny, what
can I do?”

##
Just then White Dove
flew down from the tree
to drink.

##

##
Little Ant had an idea.

##
He jumped onto one
boy's foot, and bit him
as hard as he could.

##
The boy jumped.
“Ouch!” he cried.

##
White Dove was
startled and flew away
to safety.

##
That was how Little Ant
thanked White Dove for
saving him.
