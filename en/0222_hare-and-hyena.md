# Hare and Hyena

##
Once a upon a time there lived Hare and Hyena and
the two were great neighbours.
Hyena used to own a huge farm which he loved
dearly, but it was too much work for him to plant
everything by himself.
So one day he went to see Hare and asked if he
could help him with his farm. And in return he would
pay Hare with some nuts from his farm.

##
Hare used to sit all day doing
nothing and when Hyena came
home after work, Hare would
always ask him for nuts from his
farm.
But Hyena didn't like this very
much.

##
So one day Hyena thought to
himself, "Its so hard to work all day
by myself. Maybe Hare could help
me and in return he can get some
nuts that he has actually worked
for".
Hare agreed to his terms and they
shook hands on it because he
thought it was a good deal.

##
The two worked so good together.
Hare would dig and plant and
Hyena would help and sing along as
they went.
Hyena was very happy because he
was able to plant a lot more than
before.

##
Hare was a really hard worker and
worked all day long with no rest.
But he felt like he was working too
much and wanted a raise because
what Hyena was paying too little.

##
So one afternoon when the crops
had grown, he decided to tell Hyena
that he wanted more nuts for all the
hard work he did.
"Look at all this, I planted
everything and I deserve to be paid
more," Hare said.
But Hyena wasn't having any of it.
"No, we did this together so I can't
pay you more. Don't forget who's
farm this is." He shouted
But Hare was not very happy about
this and walked away angry.

##
Hyena went home and thought to
himself "How am i going to solve
this because Hare is a very hard
worker indeed and i can't afford to
lose him."
So Hyena called Hare for a meeting
and asked him, "How much more
nuts do you want?"
Hare was very clever so he thought
about it for a while "Mmmmm do
you know what would make me
happy? is if you gave me half of
your farm."

##
Hyena thought for a moment. "Fine
you can have some only if you keep
working as hard as you have been
doing."
Hare smiled and knew he had made
a great deal. So he agreed to this.

##
But as time went by, Hare stopped
working as hard and instead he
would sit and sing all day.
Hyena worked so hard and so long,
that he was beginning to hate Hare.
He wondered why he even agreed
to the terms in the first place.

##
One day Hyena came up with a
brilliant idea to solve both their
problem.
He told Hare "If you don't help with
the chores then get off my farm."
Hare refused to get off because he
was used to the free food that he
was getting.
But Hyena was fed up and chased
him away and warned him "If i ever
catch you on my farm again, I will
eat you."
That is why to this day Hyena is
always chasing Hare when he sees
him near his land. And Hare is
always hiding in the fields trying to
steal food from farms.
