you haven't then do so because it is
interesting
One day, I and my family decided to go to
the village and pay a visit to my
grandparents, we woke up as early as
possible and got
Prepared for the journey .we had already
packed our clothes in the evening so by
12;00am in the morning we had arrived at
the bus park.

Me and my family arrived our village at
10;30. But as soon as we arrived, my grand
mother was so happy to se us , so as in our
culture me and my mother had to kneel
down and greet my grandparents except for
my father who is a man. We were so tired
and we decided to rest.

Surprisingly, realized that our village was
near the shores of lake Albert, when I asked
my nephew James he said it was true .This
made me very happy because
I had never visited the shores of any lake. I
then understood why the neighbouring
village wanted to take our land, because of
going to the I learnt how to weave
Baskets so , it is so important to the village
you learn a lot
Of skills.

So we went and rested for a while after on,
my grandparents
Decided to call all of my relatives and told
us to sit down .my nephew told me that this
was done incase of reciting a story so we all
listened carefully. When time went by, it
became dark and we had to have our supper
with all the family members ,the following
morning me and my cousins had to greet
the elders and go to fetch water.
