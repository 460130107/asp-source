# Esther takes Mummy's sweets

##
Esther is a good girl. She has many
friends from school and around
home.

##
When Esther goes to play with
friends, she picks Mummy's sweets
and gives to friends. She picks the
sweets when Mummy does not
know.

##
Mummy sees the sweets are few
but keeps quiet. Esther's friends
come home while shouting:
"Esther give us more sweets". That is
when Mummy knows that Esther
takes her sweets.

##
At night Mummy and Daddy call Esther. They ask Esther why
she takes the sweets without requesting. Esther says that she
is sorry.

##
Daddy and Mummy tell Esther
never again to pick anything
without permission.
But Esther was encouraged to
share with friends the things that
she has been given.
Esther is now a good girl.
She does not pick Mummy's
sweets.
Mummy and Daddy love Esther.
