# The Race

##
One day the rabbit
found a snail. He said to
the snail, “You can't
run! All you know is
how to crawl on the
ground.”

##
The snail said, “Come
on Sunday and you will
see.”

##
The snail prepared a
hundred bits of paper
and wrote the same
message on them.

##
The snail handed out
the papers to his
friends and said, “When
the rabbit comes here
calling me, one of you
must say: I am the
snail.”

##
Then the snail told his
friends to hide behind
the bushes where the
rabbit and the snail
were to pass.

##
On Sunday, the rabbit
arrived and found the
snail.
The rabbit said, “Let´s
have a race.
But I will win.”

##
Snails were lined up on
the racing track so that
each time the rabbit
passed, a snail would
shout, ‘I am a snail…'
During the race, the
rabbit called out,
“Snail! Snail!”

##
One of the snails hidden
behind the bushes
answered, “I am the
snail, I am the snail.”

##
Finally, the rabbit was
very tired.
He lay down, saying,
“Snail, I am so tired;
you have won.”

##
So the snail won
because of his
cleverness!
