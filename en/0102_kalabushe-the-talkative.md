# Kalabushe The Talkative

##
Long time ago, there lived a girl whose name was Kalabushe. Kalabushe was a very talkative girl. Although her mother warned her not to talk too much, Kalabushe did not listen.

##
Kalabushe's aunt lived across the valley on the other side of Kalabushe's village. One day she fell ill. She had nobody to take care of her.

##
Kalabushe's mother was very busy. It was late in the evening when she gave Kalabushe food to take to her sick aunt.

##
On the way, Kalabushe met Sinson. Sinson was a hyena who had changed into a person.

##
Sinson asked Kalabushe, "What are you carrying?" Kalabushe answered, "I am carrying meat, eggs and milk." Kalabushe's mother had warned her not to say what she was carrying.

##
Kalabushe also said, "I am taking the food to my sick aunt." Sinson licked his lips at the thought of the meat that Kalabushe was carrying.

##
Sinson quickly ran ahead of Kalabushe to her aunt's house.

##
He swallowed Kalabushe's aunt and then covered himself with her blanket.

##
When Kalabushe arrived, the house was very quiet. She went inside and called out, "Aunt, where are you?"

##
Kalabushe did not hear her aunt's voice. She went to the inner room where her aunt slept. She was surprised when she saw someone covered with a big blanket.

##
Kalabushe asked, "Aunt, why are your ears so big today?" Sinson replied from under the big blanket, "So that I can hear you well."

##
Kalabushe asked again, "Aunt, why are your eyes so big today?" Sinson answered, "So I can see you well."

##
Kalabushe finally asked, "Aunt, why is your mouth so big today?" Sinson replied, "So I can eat you up!" He jumped from the bed and swallowed Kalabushe.

##
Kalabushe kept talking even when she was inside Sinson's stomach. She asked many questions.

##
In the end, Sinson was so tired of Kalabushe's many questions that he decided to spit her out.

##
Kalabushe and her aunt were rescued by the villagers. From that day, Kalabushe did not talk too much to strangers.
