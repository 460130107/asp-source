# The tree wife

##
Once upon a time, there lived a man who had plenty of everything – a large fertile farm,
with cattle, sheep, and goats.
But, as he grew old, he grew sad, because one thing was missing.
He did not have a wife.

##
Standing under a tree one day, he
had a brilliant idea.
If he couldn't find a wife, perhaps
he could make one?

##
So he set to work to shape a
beautiful woman from a strong
branch of the tree. When he had
finished making the statue, he
touched her eyes, and they opened.
He blew gently on her, and she
came alive.

##
She was truly the most beautiful
woman he had ever seen.
He knelt before her, and asked her
to be his wife.

##
He gave her a colourful apron,
beads, and a head ring, the sign of
a married woman. And he built her
a house with the mud and grass
that used to lie at the foot of her
trunk.
“Only one thing I beg of you,” he
said to his wife. “Never tell anyone
where you come from.”

##
But before long, the young men
from a neighbouring village began
talking among themselves.
“How can such an old man have
such a beautiful young wife?”
So they decided to steal her and
take her to their own kraal.

##
The old man was heartbroken. He
felt he could not live without her.
But then he thought, “Perhaps if I
have something of hers, I would not
feel so sad?”
So he sent his doves to find her, to
sing to her, and to bring back
something of hers to him.

##
When they found her, they sang to
her in the language of birds:
Tree woman, tree woman
More beautiful than any other
Your husband has sent us
To bring back your apron!

##
She gave them her apron, and they flew over the hill, over the river, back to her husband.
He held the apron to his face, and was comforted for a little while.

##
But his longing did not go away.
So again he sent his doves to sing
to her:
Tree woman, tree woman
More beautiful than any other
Your husband has sent us
To bring back your head ring!
And back they flew with the head
ring, the sign of a married woman.

##
He held the head ring and sighed
for his wife, far away in the kraal of
other people.
After a while, he called his doves
again. He told them to go to her
and sing:
Tree woman, tree woman
More beautiful than any other
Your husband has sent us
To bring back your life!

##
So away they went the third time.
They perched on her shoulders. As
they sang, each bird pecked out an
eye.
Immediately she turned again into a
statue.
Her feet and arms fell away. Then
her head.
And she fell to the ground.

##
Her husband slowly rolled her
wooden trunk to the river.
He stood her up with her roots in
the water.
Nourished by sun and soil, she grew
leaves again.

##
And when the wind blows, the
leaves sigh.
Just as a woman does when she
longs for her husband.
