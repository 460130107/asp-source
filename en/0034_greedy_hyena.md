# Greedy Hyena

##
Atabo and Akiru went to
collect water at the
river.

##
On their way back
home they rested on a
big rock.

##
Atabo tried to stand up
to continue home but
was stuck to the rock.

##
Akiru ran home to call
mother.

##
When mother arrived at
the rock, she found
Atabo truly stuck.

##
“I will make a fence
around the rock to
protect you from wild
animals,” mother said
to Atabo.

##
So, she made a fence
with only one door
which she used to get
inside.

##
Then mother said to Atabo, “When I come to
feed you I will sing a song for you to open
the door.”
This is the song she sang:
“lka koku nachirima,
Bala ekena,
Ke...ke...i...ya.
Tangarae totokonia kainak ngakon kile.”

##
And mother also said, “Never open the door
to a stranger.”
So whenever mother came she sang the
song, the door opened and she gave Atabo
food.

##
But Hyena was hiding
and watching and
listening when mother
came to feed Atabo.

##
Hyena tried to copy the
song. He practised and
practised.

##
The other animals told
Hyena to swallow a fly
from the river so that
he could sing better.
He swallowed a fly from
the river and he came
to sing. But the door did
not open.

##
He swallowed a fly from
the plains and he came
to sing. But the door did
not open.
Finally he swallowed a
fly from the far away
plains.

##
He came to sing, and
the door opened.
Hyena ate Atabo.

##
When mother came
again, she sang, and
sang, and sang. But
nothing happened.

##
Mother called a
meeting of all the
animals and lit a very
big fire.
“The animal that ate
Atabo will fall into the
fire and burn,” she said.

##
All the animals jumped
safely over the fire until
the fox had a turn.

##
Fox jumped and the fire
caught his tail.
He cried in pain.

##
Last of all came the
hyena.
He jumped and fell in
the fire.

##
Then the animals sang
another song:
“Ata kalio,
Anikanyamit ikon koku,
Achakakin nakim na,
Chi...gi...gir.”
