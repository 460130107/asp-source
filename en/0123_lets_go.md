# Let's go

##
With my nose...

##
...I smell dirty socks.

##
...I smell beautiful
flowers.

##
With my eyes...

##
...I see a balloon
blowing away in the
wind.

##
...I see a happy cat.

##
With my mouth...

##
...I taste the salty sea.

##
...I taste a juicy sweet
orange.

##
With my hand...

##
...I take your hand.
