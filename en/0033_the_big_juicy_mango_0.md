# The Big Juicy Mango

##
Tiny shoot begins to
show, A tiny plant
begins to grow.

##
Reaching higher
towards the sun,
Reaching higher until
it's done.

##
Now it's a big tree, leafy
and green, Spreading
it's branches so it can
be seen.

##
The branches are
strong now, sturdy and
steady, The tree needs
some fruit now, the
branches are ready.

##
First comes the flowers,
then come the bees,
Then after the bees
come the fruit on the
trees.

##
The mangoes are
picked by my fumbling
hands, And put into big
baskets to eat or make
jams.

##
This juicy, red mango
looks delicious and
fresh, Inside of the skin
is bright yellow flesh.

##
Just one bite to taste it,
sweet, juicy, cool, That
one little taste is
making me drool!

##
My mango is finished, I
ate it so fast, I must get
another and it won't be
my last!
