# Where is my bat?

##
I have lost my bat, and I
cannot find it.

##
I looked behind the
door. It was not there.

##
I looked for it on the
shelf. I could not find it
there.

##
I looked for it under the
bed. Not there either.

##
I searched inside the
box. There was no sign
of it.

##
I searched the attic.
It was not there.

##
I looked here, there and
everywhere.
I could not find it
anywhere.
