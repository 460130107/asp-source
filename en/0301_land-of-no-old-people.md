# Land of no old people

##
One time it happened in a
village that a gang of young
people decided to kill all the old
people so that they would stop
doing magic.

##
But one of the youth ran off
with his father and hid him in
the desert.

##
After he had done this, the gang
began killing the old people.

##
Just then a snake came into the
village from the desert. The
snake went into the stomach of
a small child.

##
The snake kept poking its head
out of the mouth of the child.

##
The parents of the child and all
the other people tried
everything to solve this
problem. But they saw that if
they killed the snake they
would also kill the child.

##
Then the young man who had
hidden his father went and told
him everything that had
happened.?
And the old man said, "That's
the easiest thing in the world to
take care of."

##
The old man said, "Find a toad
and put it near the snake. You'll
see that the snake will come
out of the child's stomach to
catch the toad.?
The young man did just what
the old man said. And the snake
came out and started to chase
the toad. The child was saved
from death.
