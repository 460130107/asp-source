# What is wrong child?

##
This is Matende.

##
Matende cried all the time.

##
When his mother fed him, Matende cried.

##
When Matende was put down to rest, he still cried.

##
When his mother changed his nappies, Matende continued to cry.

##
When his mother carried him on her shoulder, Matende cried more.

##
When he fell asleep, Matende looked like he would start to cry again.

##
Matende's mother looked at her son.

She did not know what was wrong with him.
