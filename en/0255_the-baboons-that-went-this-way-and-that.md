# The baboons that went this way and that

##
There was much unhappiness in a village of small huts. The people
who lived there had been happy before, but then wild animals had
come and had begun to frighten them. These animals ate all their
crops and from time to time they even carried off children who
wandered away from their parents. It was not a good place to live
any longer, and the people began to think of where they might go
to lead a new life.

##

##
One family found the answer. Rather than deal with the wild
animals who seemed to be everywhere on the flat land, they
decided to go in search of food up in the hills. It was not hard to
find food there. There were bushes that grew in the cracks
between rocks. There were trees that grew at the foot of the
slopes. There were rock rabbits which could be trapped and birds
which could be brought down with the stones which littered the
floor of the caves.

Other families noticed how well the hill family was doing. They saw
the sleekness of their children, and they noticed how calm the
parents were.
"It is a good life that we lead up in the hills," said the husband.
"You should come there too."
Soon the other families abandoned their homes on the flat land
and went up to the hills. Each family found a cave to live in, and in
this way they were warm and secure. Soon everybody talked about
how sorry they were that they had not come to the hills earlier,
rather than letting the wild animals eat their crops and drag off
their children.

As the children grew up in the hills, they began to get better at the
things that had to be done to live in such a place. They became
very quick at climbing rocks, and even the youngest could
scamper up a face of rock almost as quickly as any rock rabbit.
They also became good at climbing into trees to look for fruit, and
they could swing in the branches almost as well as any monkey.
People who passed by and saw the hill people living on their hill
wondered whether they were perhaps wild animals, but when they
saw their faces and the clothes that they were wearing they
realised that they were only people who had made the hills their
home.

##
Slowly, things began to change. The parents noticed that their
children were talking less, and that rather than speaking to one
another in the language of people they were beginning to use
grunts. Then the adults themselves noticed that their noses were
getting bigger and that they were growing hairier. Every time they
looked at one another they saw that their faces had changed yet
more and that their teeth were longer.
Soon they spent as much time on four legs as on two, and it was
at this point that they became a new creature. This creature,
which had never before been seen in that place, was the creature
which people now call the baboon.

##

##
For a time, the baboons lived happily. They stopped chasing the
rock rabbits and started to eat grubs from the ground. They also
forgot how to talk, and nobody now made any sound other than a
bark or a grunt. They took off their clothes and let the rags lie on
the ground until they were destroyed by ants. Their legs and arms
were now completely covered with dark hair.
They still remembered, though, that they had been people, and
this was something which made them worried. When they looked
into each other's faces, they realised that their noses were now
much bigger than they had been before, and this made them jeer.
Every baboon laughed at every other baboon, pointing at his
enlarged nose and throwing his hands about in mirth. This made
the baboon who was being laughed at angry. He would jump up
and down in anger, all the while laughing at the large nose of the
other.

##

##
Eventually the mockery became so great that the baboons could
no longer bear to be together. Each family split off and lived by
itself, laughing at the others because of their great noses, but not
liking to be laughed at for their own noses. That is why baboons
live in small groups today and do not live as a baboon nation, as
do people and many other animals.
