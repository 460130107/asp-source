# Young Palinyang'

##
Long time ago there lived an orphan
boy called Palinyang'.
Palinyang's parents were killed by
robbers when he was only six
months old.
As the villagers mourned the death
of Palinyang's parents, they
wondered what would become of
Palinyang'.

##
After the burial, Sausau, the village
headman called a meeting.
Sausau was respected and feared at
the same time because of the way
he dressed and talked. His hair was
long and fell on his back.
It was believed that Sausau lived in
the forest long before trees were
cut down and houses were built.

##
During the meeting, Lokeyokoni, a
very rich villager, adopted
Palinyang'.
Lokeyokoni had many sons and
daughters. The daughters helped
their mother with household chores
while the sons went out to graze
their father's big herd of cattle.

##
Palinyang' grew up in this family
and was very happy.
He was loved and he loved
everybody.
He enjoyed grazing the animals in
the fields.

##
Palinyang' loved one particular cow
so much that he gave it the name
Alinyang'.
Alinyang' was the oldest cow in the
whole herd. For this reason, the
owner valued it a lot.

##
One day when the boys were out
grazing the animals, it started
raining and they had to shelter
under a tree.
The rain fell for many hours until it
was dark.
When it eventually stopped raining,
the boys went to collect the animals
and take them home but there were
no animals to be seen.

##
They were afraid of what their
father would do to them if they
arrived home without the animals.
When they could not trace the
cattle, two boys decided to go to
their uncle's home while two others
went to their aunt's place.
Palinyang' decided to continue
looking for the animals till he found
them. He had no uncle or aunt to
run to.

##
Palinyang' followed all the tracks
that he knew while singing the
name of his favourite cow.
This is how the song went:
Piii pi Alinyang'!
Piii pi Alinyang'!
Chaka akula chi!
Chaka orete chi!

##
Palinyang' went on singing the song
throughout the night.
He stepped on the cow dung but it
was cold.
He then stepped on the urine but it
was cold as well. Palinyang' did not
give up.

##
At dawn, Palinyang' reached a small
village and found the animals in the
care of the village headman. He
pleaded with the headman to let
him lead the animals home, but the
headman refused.

##
Frustrated, Palinyang' started
singing his song as he turned to go
home.
It was then that Alinyang', the
oldest cow, heard Palinyang'.
Alinyang raised her ears and started
following Palinyang'.
All the animals broke from the
enclosure and followed Palinyang.
He lead them home.

##
When they reached home, villagers were waiting
because they had heard Palinyang's voice from far.
They all sang songs praising Palinyang'.
Lokeyokoni thanked Palinyang' and bought him a red
bag for carrying books to school.
And that is how Palinyang' started going to school.
