# Lion and Warthog

##
Once upon a time, Lion was the strongest and most
feared of all the animals.
He would catch other animals and eat them.
But one morning while he was looking for his
breakfast, he got caught in a hunter's trap.

##
Lion gave his loudest roar from the pain.
He pulled and pulled to free himself from the trap.
The trap got tighter and tighter around his leg every
time he pulled.
Lion grew tired and he felt more pain in his leg.
Finally, he gave up.

##
Days went past as Lion sat baking in the sun.
He was hungry and thirsty and there was nobody to
save him.
He became weaker and weaker.
“I am going to die of hunger and thirst in this trap,”
he thought to himself.

##
One morning, Lion heard a sound coming from the
nearby bushes.
He listened and looked closer.
He saw Warthog walking with his wife and children,
talking and laughing.
The Warthog family were going to the river to drink
water and play in the mud before the sun got too
hot.

##
“Warthog! Please help me! Warthog!” cried Lion.
“Please set me free from this trap,” pleaded Lion.
“Never,” said Warthog.
“You are a cruel animal. You will eat me and my
family for breakfast if I set you free.”
“I promise I will never do such a bad thing. We will be
friends if you can set me free,” said Lion.

##
Warthog felt sorry for the lion.
“I do not like seeing you in such
pain, thirsty and dying from
hunger.”
So he pulled at the trap with his
long strong tusks and released Lion.
Warthog saved his new friend.

##
“Thank you very much my friend for
saving my life,” said Lion. “I must
go to my family now, good bye.”
“Go well my friend,” said Warthog.
He was happy that Lion was his
friend. “My family will never have to
run from the lion again,” he
thought.

##
Lion walked away limping and
weak.
He was also very hungry.
Then he saw Warthog's children
playing in the mud.
“Today is my lucky day,” said Lion
with his mouth watering.

##
“Hey Warthog, my new friend,”
called Lion.
“I have been caught in the trap for
days without food. But I am too
weak to hunt.
Please would you give one of your
children to me for breakfast?”
Warthog was shocked.
“I saved you from the trap and now
you want to eat my children?”

##
“I am very sorry my friend,” said
Lion, “but I am starving.
I might be weak for now but I am
stronger than you.”
The lion opened his mouth and
showed his strong yellow teeth.
“If you do not give me one of your
children, I will take one for myself,”
he roared.

##
Warthog knew that he did not have the speed or the
strength of Lion.
He would never be able to protect his children in a
fight.
“Al right,” said Warthog.
“I will give you one of my children.
But first I want you to show me how you were caught
in the trap.
In case I have to save another lion from this trap.”

##
Lion imagined the wonderful taste
of young warthog in his mouth.
He could hardly wait.
Lion went back to the trap and put
his foot inside to show his friend
how he was trapped.

##
“Ouch!” Lion roared.
Warthog had closed the trap on
Lion's foot.
“Aha! I got you,” said Warthog.
“You will stay in that trap hungry
and thirsty again.
See if your strong teeth and sharp
claws can help you now.”

##
“Run! Run! Run away!” Warthog's
wife shouted to the children at the
top of her voice.
“Raise your tails when you are
running so that your father can see
you,” she called.
The babies ran as fast as they could
through the bushes.

##
“Warthog please help me!” begged Lion again.
He was in pain from the sharp jaws of the hunter's
trap.
“I will do anything for you if you save me.”
“No way, liar! I will never believe you again,” said
Warthog.
“I will also warn other animals not to save you
because you are very sly.”

##
Warthog saw his children running in a row with their
mother.
Their tails were lifted up for him to see them.
He rushed to his family and they all escaped to
safety.
To this day, Warthogs and their children always run
with their tails lifted up to see that everyone is safe.
