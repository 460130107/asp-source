# Inyang and the Bird

##
Inyang was an herds-boy. His father trusted him
with the duty. He loved his only son for every
evening the cows would come home with full
stomachs.

##
One day, Inyang requested his
father to allow him migrate with
other young men with cows in
search of green pasture.This
was a tradition practiced in
their pastoralist community. like
other fathers he gave the
permission.

##
For a long time in this new
place, Inyang grew thin due to
lack of enough food.There was
nobody to cook for him, all he
depended on was the little milk
from one of the cows.

##
He one day went in the forest and caught a weaver bird. He spared the life of this
bird and sent it as a messenger back home.He instructed it to deliver the his
challenges to his parents.The bird accepted as appreciation for his mercy.

##
The bird set off.It flew for long but with rests along the way.The bird on its way
thought of how friendly Inyang was, it promised to do all it can to save him as
well.This spirit kept it flying and flying!

##
The bird flew and flew, with all
the air currents and winds
nothing could stop the mission.
From high up it could spot the
village.

##
Soon it reached at the village. From Inyangs'
description it easily identified their home.The
bird was happy for finally identifying this hut!

##
Form the top of the hut and with a soft and
unique sound it began singing.At first it
attracted no attention but as the sweet music
continued people's attention was caught.The
bird seemed to send some message and
people got closer to it.

##
The bird after the crowd gathered, explained how Inyang was suffering alone in
the grassing field.It appealed to his parents to save him.His parents then
prepared food and planned to go for Inyang.

##
They carried food for him among other
things.The set off their journey across rivers
and through forests.Finally they got there.

##
They found Inyang under the tree with his herd
of cows in the field.Although the cows looked
healthy, Inyang wasn't.He got thin and had
empty stomach.

##
The cows had eaten to their capacity.The green
grass was fresh.The cows mooed and enjoyed
this wonderful grassland.

##
Meanwhile, after greetings Inyang was fed with the delicious and appetizing
foods his parents carried for him.He enjoyed his meal as the parents admired the
grassland in the horizon.

##
His father went for the cows...He was pleased of his son and how a realy
shepherd he was.

##
Inyang ate enough and drank too. His stomach
was no longer empty but full.He was happy of
how his parents responded quickly for his help.

##
The parents then convinced Inyang to come back home.They told him how the
rains had started falling at home.Inyang hesitantly accepted to go back.He
assembled his cows and tarted the journey.

##
In his heart and mind, Inyang was grateful to
the bird for saving his life too.
