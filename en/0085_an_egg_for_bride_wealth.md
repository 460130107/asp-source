# An egg for bride wealth

##
Once upon a time, there was an old
woman who loved her grandson
very much.
She gave him an egg as a gift.
She said, “From this egg you will get
bride wealth for your marriage
when you are of age.”
And the boy went on his way.

##
First he met some blackberry
gatherers who asked him for the
egg.
They used it to shoot at the berries
and it broke.

##
The boy cried,
“Ei…Ei…Ei! You have caused trouble
for me!
The egg was not mine.
It belonged to my grandmother.
And grandmother didn't give it to
me for nothing.
She gave it to me to get bride
wealth.”

##
So the berry gatherers gave him the
stick they used to bring down the
berries.
And the boy walked on.

##
Next the boy met some builders
who asked him for his stick.
They used it to build a house and it
broke into pieces.

##
The boy cried,
“Hee…Hee…Hee! You have caused
trouble for me! The stick was not
mine, it belonged to the berry
gatherers.
And they didn't give it to me for
nothing.
They gave it to me in place of my
egg.
The egg was not mine.
It belonged to my grandmother.
And grandmother didn't give it to
me for nothing,
She gave it to me to get bride
wealth.”

##
So the builders gave him a bundle
of grass for thatching.
And the boy walked on.

##
Next the boy found a herdsman who
asked for the boy's bundle of grass.
The herdsman gave it to the cow
and the cow ate it all up.

##
The boy cried, “E…E…E! You have
caused trouble for me! The grass
was not mine. It belonged to the
builders.
The builders did not give it to me
for nothing. They broke my stick.
The stick was not mine. It belonged
to the berry gatherers.
And they didn't give it to me for
nothing.
They gave it to me in place of my
egg.
The egg was not mine. It belonged
to my grandmother.
And grandmother did not give it to
me for nothing.
She gave it to me to get bride
wealth.”

##
So the herdsman gave the boy his
cow.
And the boy walked on.

##
While on his way home, the boy
came across a marriage
celebration.
The bride's family asked him for his
cow.
He gave it to them.
And they slaughtered it and ate it
all.

##
The boy cried, “Ei…Ei…Ei! You have
caused trouble for me! The cow was
not mine. It belonged to the
herdsman.
The herdsman didn't give it to me
for nothing.
He gave it to me in place of my
bundle of grass.
The grass was not mine. It belonged
to the builders.
The builders didn't give it to me for
nothing. They broke my stick.
The stick was not mine. It belonged
to the berry gatherers.
They didn't give it to me for
nothing. They gave it to me in place
of my egg.
The egg was not mine. It belonged
to my grandmother.
And grandmother didn't give it to
me for nothing,
She gave it to me to get bride

##
Then the bride's family said, “We
have nothing left to pay you. But let
us give you the bride.”
And so, the saying came to pass
that, “What goes round comes
around!”
