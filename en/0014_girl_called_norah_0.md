This is a girl called
Norah.
Her doll's name is
Selah.

##
Norah loves her doll
very much.
Norah plays with Selah
every day.
She sleeps with her doll
every night.

##
One day, Norah could
not find her doll.
She looked everywhere,
but could not find
Selah.
Norah got very worried.

##
Norah did not know that
her mother took Selah
for washing.
She hung the doll
outside to dry.

##
“I can't find my doll,”
cried Norah.
“Don't worry,” said her
mother.

##
That evening, Norah's
mother gave the doll to
Norah.
The doll was very clean.
Selah looked like a new
doll!

##
Norah was very happy.
She jumped up and
down.
She danced.
She laughed loudly.

##
And she thanked her
mother.
