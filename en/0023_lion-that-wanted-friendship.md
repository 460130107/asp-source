# Lion that wanted friendship

##
Once upon time, a lion
wanted to come out of
the bush and have a
human as a friend.

##
And so the lion and the
man became friends.

##
They ate together and
shared meat. The lion
realised that the man
was a meat lover. It
began to fear that the
man would kill it.

##
The lion feared that
perhaps the man might
spear it with his spears.
The man feared that
the lion might eat him
at night when he slept.

##
One night the man
dreamed that the lion
was moving towards
him slowly, trying to eat
him.

##
The man took up his
spear, shouting, "If you
want to eat me, then I
will spear you." The lion
woke up and ran out, "I
said this man will one
day kill me."

##
From that day, the lion
and the man were no
longer friends. The lion
will kill a human
whenever it finds one.
And humans will kill a
lion if they can.

##
That is why it is said: if someone wants
friendship with you, you should first know
about that person's character. You should
know if you can be together peacefully.
