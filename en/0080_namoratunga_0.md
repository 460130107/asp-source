# Namoratunga

##
Long time ago, in a Turkana
village, people loved to dance
the edonga dance.

##
Every evening they gathered
together and danced edonga.
The whole region came to know
of this village and its dancers.

##
People from the nearby villages
also came to dance edonga.

##
A stranger heard of the famous
village. He sent his messenger
to go there before him.

##
When the messenger arrived,
the villagers were afraid. They
wondered who the stranger
was, and why he had sent his
messenger. The villagers
prepared food and animals to
be slaughtered.

##
The villagers gathered and
prepared sacrifices. They sat
the whole day until evening.
But the stranger did not arrive.

##
In the evening, the villagers
danced as usual until midnight.
That night there were many
dancers. Everybody in the
village was excited.

##
Before the dance ended, the
stranger arrived. Even though
he was a stranger, he looked
just like the other villagers.
They did not notice him at first.

##
When it was the stranger's turn
to dance, he joined the men.
But his dancing was strange
and different from the others.

##
People were amused and began
to laugh at the stranger. Some
dancers fell down laughing.
Some sat down, and others
knelt laughing.

##
The stranger did not like people
laughing at him. He decided to
curse them. He stopped
dancing and everyone became
a stone in the position they
were in. Some were lying down,
others standing, others sitting
and kneeling. Then the stranger
left the village.

##
Since then, those stones remained there. At night they can
be heard singing and dancing edonga. That is how we have
the site of Namoratunga.
