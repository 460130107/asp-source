# Elephant and Chameleon

##
Once upon a time in a big
palace, there lived a king and
his
beautiful daughter, the
princess.

##
Elephant lived in a house on
one side of the palace.
Chameleon
lived on the other side.

##
At this time, there was a terrible
drought across the land.
The king had an idea and called
his two neighbours to the
palace.

##
The kind said to Elephant and
Chameleon, “I want you to
stomp
on the ground with your feet
until water comes out.”
The king promised the princess
in marriage to the one who
succeeded.

##
Chameleon had no hope since
he was very small.
Elephant was extremely happy
since he was so big and
powerful.
Elephant went to the field and
started stomping on the
ground.

##
A lot of dust came, but no
water.
Elephant stomped on the
ground until water was almost
coming out, but he was too
tired.
He gave Chameleon a chance
to try.

##
Chameleon started stomping on
the ground. After a short while,
water came out.
People could not believe their
eyes!

##
So the King gave the beautiful
princess to Chameleon.
Elephant went home annoyed.
