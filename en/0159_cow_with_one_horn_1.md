##
Heeeee! There is a
beautiful cow at home.

##
It has no tail and only
one horn.
It looks so beautiful.

##
It is fat, and has a big
stomach.

##
It is the strongest cow.

##
Its shepherd loves this
cow very much.
He has taught this cow
to listen only to his
voice.

##
When the herd go to
the fields to graze, this
cow eats alone.

##
This cow is a great
fighter, so the other
cows leave it alone.

##
People know this cow.
They are afraid of it,
because it can fight
with its one horn.
If you met such a cow,
what would you do?
