# The wise man

##
Once upon a time, there was a
man who thought that the
youth were wiser than their
elders. He even bragged about
it before his wife.
He said to her, "I am wiser than
your father."
His wife disagreed with him, but
he would not listen to her.

##
One day when the wife went to
see her parents, she told her
father about how his son-in-law
claims to be wiser than him
because he is younger.
The old man sent his daughter
back to ask her husband if he
still held the same view.

##
Her husband sent her back. "Go
and tell your father to prepare
for me a drink brewed from
mist."
"Now I will prove to my fatherin-law that I am indeed very
wise," he chuckled.
No one can make a drink from
mist.

##
The father-in-law just laughed it
off as no alcohol could be made
out of mist. However, the old
man sent the daughter back
with a message accepting the
challenge of preparing a brew
from mist. But on condition that
when it was ready, the one to
collect it should neither be a
man nor a woman.

##
The son-in-law found himself
trapped.
From that time, he believed in
the old saying that "Shoulders
will never grow taller than the
head."
