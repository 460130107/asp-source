# Big blue bus

##
There was only
one bus in
Ebei's village.
It was big and blue.
It was very noisy.

##
One day, Ebei's
mother said,
“Tomorrow we will
go to town to buy
your school uniform.”

##
Ebei was very excited.
They would travel
in the big blue
bus.
He could not sleep
that night.

##
Ebei was already
dressed when his
mother came to
wake him.

##
Ebei and his mother
walked to the
bus stop.
They waited for
the big blue bus.
But the bus
did not come.

##
Other people arrived
at the bus stop.
They complained
because the bus
was late.
“Has the bus
left us?”
they asked.

##
Ebei was worried.
"We will not be able
to go to town.
I will not be able
to get my uniform,"
he thought.

##
Some people gave up
and went home.
But Ebei cried and
did not want to go.
His mother
comforted him.
“We will wait
a bit longer,” she said.

##
Suddenly, they heard
a noise.
They saw dust
in the air.
The bus was coming!

##
But this bus was not
blue. It was not big.
This bus was red
and small.
The waiting people
looked at this bus.
They did not get in.

##
“Get in! Get in!”
shouted the driver.
“We are very late
today,” he said.

##
Ebei and his mother
got in first.
Soon everyone else
got in the small
red bus.

##
Ebei looked out the
window. He saw
more people at
the bus stop.

##
Even more people
were running to
catch the bus.
But they were too late.
The bus was full.
The red bus left
for town.

##
“Where is the big
blue bus?” asked
Ebei's mother.
“It broke down,”
replied the driver.
“We are fixing it.
It will come tomorrow,”
he added.

##
Ebei did not care
about the colour of
the bus.
He did not care
about the size of
the bus.
He was happy
because this bus
was going to town.
