# Swimming

##
Once upon a time there
lived two friends,
Tortoise and Snake.

##
On day Tortoise said to Snake, “Let us go and swim.”
“Alright, but I don't know to swim,” answered Snake.
“I will teach you,” replied Tortoise.

##
They went to a swimming pool. “Who will enter the water
first?” asked Tortoise.
“You will, and I will watch you,” said Snake.

##
Tortoise entered the swimming pool. Snake observed from
the steps.

##
After some time, Snake entered the pool as Tortoise gave
instructions.

##
Tortoise and Snake swam in the shallow end of the pool.

##
They started floating on the water.

##
As they were floating,
Tortoise started
swimming backstroke.
While imitating Tortoise,
Snake could not propel
himself and started
drowning.

##
On realising that Snake had disappeared, Tortoise hurriedly
went under water and rescued the life of the snake.

##
As soon as Tortoise got
out of the water, he
turned Snake upsidedown in order to get rid
of the water that Snake
swallowed.

##
Finally, Tortoise used the mouth-to-mouth method to remove
more water.
