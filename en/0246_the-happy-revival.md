# The happy revival

##
For ages, Olokwango hill stood
smiling at the middle of Kwere
Plains. From the two dimples on its
side came springs which converged
downhill to form a river.
River Temu meandered silently
across the Kwere plains. Its waters
were a gift to the sheep and goats
of the area as well as the deer that
dwelt in the plains.

##
Things were all well until Matata
became headman.
He ordered a path to be cleared
from the top of the hill to the foot so
that he could climb uphill easily and
roll gently down to the foot.
Olokwango hill was angry with the
damage to his beard, but he was
patient.

##
During the weekend, Matata's
children and their friends would
climb uphill to play.
They would run all over the place,
breaking twigs and branches,
lighting fires for their games, which
they would later leave burning.

##
Over time, Olokwango lost patience.
The dimples became smaller and
smaller as his face turned into ugly
wrinkles.
At last the springs were no more.
The deer in the plains migrated
because there was no more tall
green grass to play in. The sheep
and goats grew thinner and thinner.
Everyone felt the sadness of
Olokwango hill.

##
The people of Kwere realised that something needed
to be done.
They joined hands and overthrew Matata the
headman.
In his place they appointed Baraka who immediately
ordered everyone to plant a flower to honour
Olokwango. Baraka and his people held ceremonies
and brought gifts of pine, cedar, and cypress for
Olokwango.

##
No one walked on the hill any
longer, and the grass had a chance
to grow tall once again. Gradually,
the smile on the face of Olokwango
hill grew broader and the dimples
deeper. Out of the dimples the
springs ran again. River Temu was
revived. The plains became greener
than ever before. The deer galloped
happily once more across the grass.

##
"Long live Baraka, long live
Baraka," the people of Kwere sang.
"Long live Olokwango," said Baraka
and his people. "May our children
and children's children forever
respect you."
