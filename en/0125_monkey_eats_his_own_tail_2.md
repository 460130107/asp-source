# Monkey Eats his Own Tail

##
For a long time, Rabbit
and Monkey were great
friends.

##
However, Rabbit was
jealous of Monkey
because of his long tail.
One day they went for a
walk.

##
They went to the shamba and ate maize.

##
Rabbit tricked Monkey
to be trapped by the
farmer.

##
Clever rabbit shouted,
"Robbers! Robbers!"
And ran away.

##
The monkey could not
run fast because of his
long tail.

##
The farmers shouted:
Stop! Stop!

##
They caught him and
started beating him.

##
The monkey revealed
how his friend Rabbit
invited him to the
shamba.

##
But the owners did not
want to listen.
"We will cut off your
tail," they said.

##
Rabbit took Monkey's
tail secretly and cooked
it.
Then he invited the
Monkey for the meal.

##
After the meal, the
monkey said, "The
meat was delicious."

##
Rabbit smiled and said,
"It was your tail," and
ran away.
And from then on they
became enemies!
