# Kumbana's Child

##
Once there was a young
man called Kumbana.

##
When he was 25, he fell
in love with a girl called
Zangane.

##
They were together for
3 years, but he didn't
have enough money to
marry
her.

##
Then one day she found
she was pregnant,
because they didn't use
protection.

##
A little girl was born,
and they called her
Kheri.

##
But Kumbana was still
studying, and Zangane
had a job in a town far
away, so they had to
live apart.

##
After a while, Zangane
found a new boyfriend.
He came to live with
her and the little girl.

##
Kumbana was heartbroken. He cried and
cried because he was
separated from his
daughter.

##
Time went on, and
Kumbana found a new
girlfriend too. They
lived together, but they
did not have any
children.

##
Now Kheri did not like
her new father at all.
She was very unhappy,
and he used to beat
her.

##
So when she was 12,
her mother decided to
send her back to live
with her real father.

##
Then Kumbana and
Kheri were both happy
again.
