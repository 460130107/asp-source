# The boy who nobody loved

##
Once upon a time, there was a boy
who was so ugly that nobody loved
him, even his parents.
At home, he would sit alone while
his family watched television.

##
At school, you would find him sitting
alone while other children were
playing.

##
When they went to fetch the cattle,
you would find him walking behind
all the other boys because they
didn't want to walk with him.

##
One day he decided to leave, but he
didn't know where he would go. He
walked until he got to an indigenous
forest. He started to get scared but
was comforted by the thought that
nobody would speak to him
because nobody loved him.

##
When he was about to enter the
forest, an old, dirty, ugly woman
came up to him. She greeted him
and asked what he was doing in the
scary forest. The boy was shocked
to hear someone speaking to him.
He told the old woman that he was
going anywhere because nobody
loved him.

##
The old woman asked if he needed
help. He responded quickly and said
“Yes”. The old woman said that
before she helped him, she wanted
him to lick her face until she was
clean and beautiful.

##
The boy didn't have any other
option but to lick the old woman's
face in order to get the help he
needed. He started licking the sleep
from her eyes, the snot from her
nose and the wax from her ears. He
licked her face until she was clean
and beautiful.

##
The old woman thanked him. She
said, “You will find many wonderful
things in the forest, but don't take
any of these things. Only bring back
the root that you find.”

##
The boy ran, wanting to see all of
those things in the forest. But
before he could enter the forest, the
old woman called him. She said,
“Boy! Come back here!” He ran
back to her and said, “I'm here”.
She asked him if he had heard what
she said to him. “I said you will find
many wonderful things in the forest,
but don't take any of these things.
Only bring back the root that you
find,” she repeated. The boy
nodded and so the old woman
allowed him to go into the forest.

##
The boy ran off, but before he could
enter the forest, he heard a voice
saying, “Boy! Come back here!” He
started to be confused about what
the old woman wanted. He ran back
to her. She said, “I don't think you
heard me properly. I said you will
find many wonderful things in the
forest, but don't take any of these
things. Only bring back the root that
you find.” The boy nodded and ran
back to the forest.

##
Just after he had entered the forest,
he heard a voice again saying,
“Boy! Come back here!” He tried to
ignore the voice but he continued
hearing it so he went back to the
old woman. The old woman said, “I
don't trust you. I don't think you'll
do what I ask you to do. I said you
will find many wonderful things in
the forest, but don't take any of
these things. Only bring back the
root that you find.” The boy was
starting to become annoyed with
the repetition. He ran faster than
before, until he was in the forest.

##
Once he was in the forest, he saw a
bowl filled with money. He took the
money and put it in his pocket. All
of a sudden, he thought about what
the old woman said, that he mustn't
take anything except the root.

##
He took the money out his pocket and put it back in the bowl.

##
He looked around and saw some
splendid new clothes. He took off
the clothes he was wearing and put
on the new ones. Again he thought
about what the old woman had
said. He took off the new clothes
and put his old ones back on.

##
He looked around and saw the root.
It was withered from the sun. He
asked himself what the old woman
thought he would do with the root.
Next to the root, there was a bowl
of food. The food smelled delicious
and the boy was hungry. He
couldn't stop himself from eating
the food.

##
When he had finished, he
remembered what the old woman
had told him. He remembered that
the old woman had said he must
only take the root. He looked
around for the root, but he couldn't
see it.

##
He went back, feeling disappointed,
to tell the old woman what had
happened. But he couldn't find her
where he had left her.
