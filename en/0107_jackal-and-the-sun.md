# Jackal and the sun

##
Long ago, there was a foolish lazy
jackal. He lived with his old father in
the Kalahari bush.

##
One morning Old Jackal woke up to
find his son sleeping in the sun. The
food was not ready and the goats
were still in the kraal!
"Young man, you are so lazy! Go
and find a wife. I am too old to look
after you," said Jackal's father. So
Jackal jumped up and took the
goats out to graze.

##
In the bush, he saw something
shining on a rock. He went closer
and closer to the rock. The closer he
got, the more beautiful the shine
was. Perhaps this was the wife for
him?!

##
"You are beautiful," said Jackal to
the shine. "But who are you? Why
are you alone?"
"I am the sun," the shine answered.
"My family left me here when they
moved on. They did not want to
carry me. I am too hot."

##
The jackal said, "But you are so
beautiful! I will carry you. I will take
you home to meet my father."
"All right, you can carry me. But do
not complain when I get too hot for
you," said the sun.

##
So Jackal put the sun on his back
and started the journey home.
Before long, the sun was burning
Jackal's fur.
"Will you please come down from
my back? I need to rest," said
Jackal. His back was so sore that he
could hardly walk.
"Just carry on!" said the sun. "I told
you not to complain!"

##
Then Jackal saw a log across the
path. He crawled under the log so
that the sun would fall off.

##
But the log also scraped the skin
and fur from his back and they were
left behind with the sun.

##
The new fur was a different colour
to the fur on the rest of his body.
The different colours always
reminded Jackal not to be so foolish
again.

Story notes
In 2005, Naro storyteller Bega Cgase from the Kalahari Desert in
Botswana told this story to Marlene Winberg, who retells it here.
The story appears in different versions in many southern African
San communities. It warns foolish young men not to be confused
by the outside appearance of a girl, and tells parents not to force
their children to marry for the sake of domestic help. It also
provokes the powerful presence of the hot sun in the desert and
does what stories do â€“ give everything in nature a personality.
The illustrations in this story are from story boards by Marlene
Winberg, interpreted digitally by Satsiri Winberg through
manipulations of the Manyeka Art Collection of paintings made by
San artists /Thaalu Rumao, /Tuoi Samcuia and Joao Wenne
Dikuango, who have all passed away since.
