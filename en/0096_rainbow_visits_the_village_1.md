# Rainbow visits the village

##
Kobole lived in a small
village.

##
One afternoon, Kobole
was out picking passion
fruits. Something
unusual happened.

##
He saw colourful lines
curved across the sky.

##
He dropped all the fruit
and ran home to tell the
villagers.

##
He found everybody
already standing
outside their homes.
They were looking at
the sky.

##
Kobole said, “It is a
beautiful cloth hanging
from the sky.” Neno
said, “No! I think
someone is pouring
paint from the sky.”

##
Some people agreed
with Kobole. Others
thought that Neno was
right. The two groups
argued.

##
A man from a faraway
village arrived and said,
“You are all wrong.”

##
The people shouted,
“Then what is it?”

##
The stranger said, “It is
the rainbow. Have you
never seen the rainbow
before?”

##
“What is a r-a-i-n-b-ow?” the villagers asked,
looking at the stranger.

##
Neno asked, “Is it ours?
Can we keep it here?”
But the man had
already gone away.
