# Keke's swing

##
Keke sat on her swing.
She loved her swing.
It was the best swing at her
school.

##
Keke moved slowly on her
swing.
Backwards and forwards.
Backwards and forwards.
When Keke moved, her swing
went faster and faster.
Soon she was right at the top.

##
Keke looked down at the
ground.
She was very high up.
“Aeei,” she called, “Look how
high I am!”

##
She was happy to be so high.
She could see the whole village.
She was nearly as high as birds
flying over the cornfields.

##
After a while Keke wanted to
come down.
The swing would not stop.
“Oh, oh, oh,” she called.
“I don't know how to stop this
swing!”

##
The swing went on and on.
Up and down, up and down.
Keke was frightened.
“Where will this swing take me?
I might go up to the moon.
I must get off!” she cried.

##
So Keke let go of the swing.
She fell down, down, down.

##
“Oh, oh, oh,” cried the other
children.
Keke fell to the ground.
She hurt her head.
“Eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeh,” she
cried.
The other children were very
worried.

##
Keke did not know what to do.
“Eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeh,” she cried
again.
The children called their
teacher.
“Ma Mpho. Please come!” they
called.
“Keke fell off the swing. She has
hurt her head.”

##
Ma Mpho ran to the swing.
She picked Keke up off the
ground.

##
Ma Mpho kissed Keke's head.
Keke smiled, “That's better
now.”
“I will not go on that swing by
myself again,” she said.
“I never want to go to the
moon.”

##
“Next time I will be with you on
your swing, Keke,” said Ma
Mpho.
“We can go to the moon
together!”
