# Disability is not inability

##
One day I met Agnes.
Agnes is a teacher.

##
Agnes walks with
crutches.

##
When I went to the
shop, I saw Metobo.
He is a radio DJ.

##
Metobo has albinism.
He has problems with
his eyes.

##
My neighbour is Moraa.
She is a farmer.

##
Moraa has a problem
with hearing.
She speaks with Sign
language.

##
Osero is the best soccer
player at my school.

I like watching him play.

##
Osero had an accident
with his hands.
But he can win matches
with his feet!

##
Now I know that even
people with challenges
can do anything!

##
I will tell my friend
Jackie not to give up.

##
Hurray!
We can all do
everything in life!
Hurray!
