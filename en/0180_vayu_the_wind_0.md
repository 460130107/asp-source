# Vayu, the wind

##
Everytime I finish my hot, hot
bath.
My wet body feels so cool, cool
cool.
What makes that happen?
Vayu, the wind!

##
The milk in my cup - too hot,
too hot.
But soon it is ready for me to
gulp.
Who makes that happen?
Vayu, the wind!

##
The window curtains flutter and
gently brush my face.
Who makes it happen?
Vayu, the wind!

##
A bolt of lightning far away.
Black clouds moving my way.
Who makes that happen?
Vayu, the wind!

##
Branches sway and leaves
tremble.
Flowers gently fall.
Who did it all?
Vayu, the wind!

##
Far from the house, we are
playing, yet, I can smell the
sweets mother is preparing.
Who makes it happen?
Vayu, the wind!

##
A glass tumbler on a windowsill,
crashes on the ground.
I am glad I was not around.
Who played this mischief?
Of course, it was Vayu, the
wind!

##
A whistle blows. A train rolls in.
I cannot see, but hear its din.
Who makes that happen?
Vayu, the wind!

##
Cannot be seen.
Cannot be heard.
Does all the work without a
word.
Who can it be?
Of course!
The wind!
