# Who is Big?

##
Ant looked at the little
plants and pebbles
around him. "I am big!"
he said.

##
"No, Ant. You are not
big," said Squirrel. "I am
big!"

##
"No, Squirrel. You are
not big," said Cat. "I am
big!"

##
"No, Cat. You are not
big," said Hyena, "I am
big!"

##
"No, Hyena. You are not
big," said Rhinoceros, "I
am big!"

##
"No, Rhinoceros. You
are not big," said
Elephant, "I am big!"

##
Then Elephant looked
up at the sky. The sky
was full of stars. The
sky was big and wide
forever in every
direction. "No, I am not
big, either! All of us are
small!"
