# 'M'e Maneo's pumpkin

##
One day, 'M'e Maneo planted a
pumpkin seed. It grew into a very
big pumpkin. It blocked her garden
path.

##
‘M'e Maneo wanted to move the
pumpkin. She went to her
neighbour. “‘M'e Mapalesa,' she
said, “please help me to move my
pumpkin. It is blocking my path.”
The two ladies pushed and pushed,
but that pumpkin did not move.

##
They went to ‘M'e Masello. “Please
help us move ‘M'e Maneo's
pumpkin!” they asked. ‘M'e Masello
came to help them. The three ladies
pushed and pushed that pumpkin,
but still it did not move. “I don't
know what to do,” said ‘M'e Maneo.

##
Just then a little worm came into
‘M'e Maneo's garden. It was hungry.
It nibbled the big pumpkin. “Stop,”
said the pumpkin. But the little
worm nibbled again.

##
“Stop! You are tickling me,” said the
pumpkin. “I don't like it.” And the
pumpkin rolled away down the hill.

##
The pumpkin stopped in a field at
the bottom of the hill. Two
shepherds found it. “What shall we
do with this pumpkin?” they asked.
“Let's eat it,” they said, “it looks
delicious.”

##
They took a big stone and tried to
break open the pumpkin.

##
“No!” cried the pumpkin. The
shepherds jumped back. The
pumpkin began to open.

##
Out of the pumpkin came a moloi.
She had one arm, one eye and one
leg. She looked terrible. “Don't
disturb me,” said the moloi in a big
voice, “I am the pumpkin chief.”
The pumpkin closed again.

##
The shepherds were very
frightened. They ran home to tell
their parents. "Oh! We are so
lucky!" said their parents. "Don't
you know about the pumpkin
moloi?" "It is a very special
pumpkin," said the shepherds'
parents. "You must leave it alone."

##
"Next summer the pumpkin will open again and the moloi will
scatter pumpkin seeds all over our villages. We will have many,
many pumpkins to eat," said the shepherd's parents.

##
And so it happened that the next
summer, ‘M'e Maneo's pumpkin
burst open. It was full of many,
many seeds.

##
Out came the pumpkin moloi. With
her one leg she climbed out of the
pumpkin. With her one eye she
looked across all the villages. With
her one arm she threw all those
seeds across the valley.

##
The seeds grew into beautiful big
pumpkins in all the gardens in the
valley. That winter everyone in the
villages had lots of pumpkins to eat.
They went to ‘M'e Maneo. “Thank
you, ‘M'e Maneo!” they cried.
