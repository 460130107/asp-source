# Baby snatched by cranes

##
Once upon a time there was a
family who lived in a village. The
parents in this family woke up early
every morning to work in the fields.
They left the baby with their elder
son, Sipho who was ten years old,
and their eldest daughter Bulelwa,
who was twelve years old.

##
The older children loved playing
outside during the day and they
forgot about doing their household
chores. They called their friends to
come and play with them. The boys
loved playing soccer. The girls loved
playing with dolls around the yard.
They forgot about looking after the
baby when their friends arrived. The
baby cried and cried and nobody
heard.

##
One day the children put the baby
under a tree in the shade on a
bright red blanket. They went to
play. The baby began crying as
usual. A group of cranes flew above
the playground and felt sorry for the
crying baby. They tried to get the
children to notice that the baby was
crying but the children kept on
playing. The cranes decided to take
the baby and raise it themselves.

##
Four cranes came to pick up the
baby from under the tree. Each
crane took a corner of the baby's
blanket, lifted the baby up and flew
away. The children did not notice
anything because they were busy
playing. The children's parents were
working hard in the hot sun.

##
It was so hot that the mother
decided to rest under a tree. While
she was resting she heard her baby
crying. She looked around and she
could not see anything. Then she
looked up and she saw four cranes
flying away with her baby in the
bright red blanket. She screamed
and chased after the cranes. When
the woman told her husband what
she saw he did not believe her.

##
The cranes hid the baby between
the reeds to protect it. They wanted
to find a new family that would care
for the baby. They fed it and put it
to sleep. Then they flew away to
look for more food. The baby slept
for a long time without crying.
When the baby woke up it started
crying because it was hungry.

##
A big frog heard the baby's cry. It
came closer and saw the baby
wrapped in the blanket. The frog
thought the cranes had stolen the
baby, and decided to hide the baby
from the cranes. Suddenly the frog
heard the voices of the cranes.
There was no time to hide. The frog
swallowed the baby and hid behind
a big rock. When the cranes arrived
they could not find the baby and
they flew off to look for it. The frog
hopped back to the baby's family
home.

##
The baby's family was sitting in the
evening feeling very sad. Suddenly,
a big frog jumped through the door.
The frog told them about how it
swallowed their baby. They begged
the frog to give them the baby.
“Give me three flies to eat then I
will give you the baby,” said the
frog.” The father caught three flies
and fed them to the frog. The frog
coughed and the baby popped out.
The family and the frog jumped and
danced with joy.
