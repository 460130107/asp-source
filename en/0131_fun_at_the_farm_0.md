# Fun at the farm

##
In a far away town, there lived a
boy named Themba.
Everyone in the town was tired of
Themba breaking things and
drawing on walls, so his mum
decided that farm work was the
only place he would not be able to
break or ruin anything. So she sent
him to work at the farm with Sipho
the herdsman.

##
Early in the morning Themba and
Sipho would go to the farm and look
after the animals and water the
crops.

##
The more that Themba worked in
the farm the more it felt like doing
chaos and no longer fun.
Themba started to get tired and
annoyed with the place, but Sipho
would always encourage him and
tell him that it can be fun.

##
Sipho would go and play with the
animals. He would feed them and
talk to them. But Themba would sit
and just watching, he didn't feel like
working in the farm anymore. He
thought it was a waste of time for
him.

##
After seeing how much fun Sipho
was having, Themba decided to go
and join in the fun.

##
But Themba started getting carried
away and what seemed like fun now
felt horrible for Sipho.

##
"Now this is fun! you were right
Sipho, working in the farm is so
much fun. Hahahahah" said
Themba

##
Themba destroyed the farm and let
all the animal out of the farm and
led the to town.

##
Soon the animals were all over the
town and people started shouting at
Themba. Everyone new that trouble
from the naughthy boy was back
again.
Chickens were running everywhere,
the other animals were eating and
breaking things in the town. It was
all a big mess.

##
It all got out of hand and the
animals started chasing Themba
and the people.
"Oh no, what have i done?" said
Themba

##

##
So Sipho told Themba that they
have to get the animals back to the
farm and clean up the place before
his mum comes from work or else
they will both be in big trouble.
They started cleaning and fetching
water to water the plants that
Themba had destroyed and got all
the animals back to the farm in
time.

##
In no time the garden was back to
the way it was.
"Thank you so much Sipho, we had
put the garden back to how it was"
Themba shouted
"Yesss! we did it Themba" Sipho
said cheerfully

##
Now instead of messing the farm
Themba and Sipho would sit and
enjoy the Apples from the Apple
tree and play with the animals.
Themba never again did as he had
done before, he now listened to
Sipho and realised that being at the
farm can also be fun without
vandalising the place.
