# Letter to mum

##
Mother was finishing
packing her clothes in a
small bag.

##
As she went out the
door, she hugged me
and said, “Bye for now.”

##
“Where are you going,
mum?” I looked up at
her as I asked.

##
I started to cry wanting
to follow her but dad
lifted me up on his
shoulder.

##
Dad said, “Your mother
is going to the hospital
to have a baby.”

##
When I heard “baby” I
stopped crying and
looked at him. “Why is
she going to get the
baby from the
hospital?” I asked him.

##
Dad sat me on a small
chair and said, “I will
tell you why she is
going to get the baby
from the hospital.”

I listened keenly to him as he explained
although I didn't quite understand why she
wasn't having the baby at home. When dad
finished explaining, I asked, “Will she still
love me when she comes back with the
other baby?”

##
My dad held me close
and said, “We will
always love you.”

##
“Can I write a letter to
her while she is there?”
I asked dad.

##
That evening, I began
to write a letter to
mum.

##
I tore a paper from my
exercise book and
began to write...

##
“Mummy, mummy, dad
said that you have gone
to bring another baby...

##
...Please hurry up and
return home...

##
...I want you to bring a
baby girl, so I can play
with her when she
grows up...

##
...You can bring two so
one can be mine...

##
...I am waiting for you
here outside our
house.”

##
I folded my letter so I
could give it to my
father to bring it to
mum. When I woke up
the following morning,
the letter was gone.
