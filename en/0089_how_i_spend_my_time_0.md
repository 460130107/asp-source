# How I Spend My Time

##
My name is Erecho Jonathan. I like reading
story books because they help us know
more about English to speak and write. I like
every meal but my best meal is called
potato flat breads.Whenever I come back
from school, I immediately go to the
refrigerator to get my potato flat breads.
When I do not find them there, I run to my
mother in the shopprite because that is
where she works from as a cashier, I request
her to go and pick for me potato flat breads
because I like them so much.

I go to Naguru Parents School in a district
called Kampala where my aunt called Tracy
stays. I like her daughters called; Pihu,
Phiona, Prescius, Pretty. Pihu is in senior six.
I am finishing my studies this year and I
want to be a doctor by profession and build
my own hospital.
