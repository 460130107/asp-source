# The friend I miss

##
Every morning when I
woke up I hurried to eat
my breakfast.

##
Then I would take my blue blouse and run out of the house
to find my friend Muthoni.

##
Once I found Muthoni,
we would forget
everything else.

##
Muthoni and I would play hide and seek.
I hid in big trees, while Muthoni went behind huts.

##
Muthoni and I went to the village well
together.
We went to fetch firewood together.
We went to school together.

##
We promised each other that we would work hard in school
and graduate.

##
But one day, Muthoni
did not come to school.
I stood at the door to
our class and waited for
her to arrive.
But she did not come.

##
When I returned home that day, I told my mother about my
friend Muthoni.

##
I continued with school,
but I missed Muthoni
very much.

##
But every day I went to
school, I looked for
Muthoni everywhere.

##
Now I am a lady, but I still miss my friend Muthoni.
