# My family and I

##
My dinosaur and I look at my birds in the sky.

##
My birds and I meet Chimpanzee in the tree.

##
My chimpanzee and I play with my giraffes on the hill.

##
My giraffes and I make monkey balls from clay.

##
My monkey and I eat bananas with Gorilla every day.

##
My gorilla and monkey fear Tortoise in every way.

##
Tortoise and I go home very slowly with Snake.

##
Snake and I love to hiss and sing songs by the lake.

##
My entire family and I live together in great happiness!
