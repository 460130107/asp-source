# Sleepy Mr. Sloth

##
One day, Mr. Sloth
came to visit. He said:

I'm sleepy! I need a
good branch for a bed!

##
I'm quite good at
climbing.
I know how to swing.
But sleeping's my
favourite, favourite
thing.

##
This branch looks
lovely!
I think I'll sleep here.

And you? Don't you
think that's a splendid
idea?

##
Oh no, Mr. Sloth! A
giraffe's eating there!
He might think you're
lunch and start nibbling
your hair!

##
This branch looks
lovely!
I think I'll sleep here.
And you? Don't you
think that's a splendid
idea?

##
Oh no, Mr. Sloth!
There's
a beehive right there!
You'll never get sleep
with those bees
everywhere!

##
This branch looks
lovely!
I think I'll sleep here.
And you? Don't you
think that's a splendid
idea?

##
Oh no, Mr. Sloth, that's
a snake over there!
Not a branch! Poor old
snake. You gave him
quite a scare.

##
This branch looks
lovely!
I think I'll sleep here.
And you? Don't you
think that's a splendid
idea?

##
Oh no, Mr. Sloth!
There's
a bird squawking there!
You'll never get sleep
with that noise in the
air!

##
Try climb one more
branch, Mr. Sloth! they
all said.
And that branch was
just the right one for his
bed.

##
The bird and the snake,
the giraffe and each
bee
were happy to have Mr.
Sloth in their tree.
