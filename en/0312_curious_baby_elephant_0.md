# Curious baby elephant

##
Everyone knows that
the elephant has a very
long nose.

##
But a long time ago, the
elephant's nose was
short and fat. Like a
shoe in the middle of
his face.

##
Then a curious Baby
Elephant was born. She
had a question for
every animal.

##
She was curious about
Giraffe.
“Why do you have a
long neck?” she asked.

##
She was curious about
Rhino.
“Why does your horn
have a sharp point?”

##
She was curious about
Hippo.
“Why do you have red
eyes?” she asked.

##
And she was VERY
curious about Crocodile.
“What does Crocodile
eat for dinner?”

##
“Never ask a question
like that!” said her
mother.
She walked off,
frowning.

##
But clever Crow quickly
said, “Follow me to the
river. There you will see
what Crocodile eats for
dinner.”

##
So Baby Elephant
followed Crow all the
way down to the river.

##
She pushed through the
reeds and stood on the
bank.
She looked into the
water.
Where was Crocodile?

##
“Hello,” said a stone
near the river bank.
“Hello,” said Baby
Elephant.
“Perhaps you can tell
me what Crocodile eats
for dinner?”

##
“Bend down and I will
tell you,” said the
stone. “Lower, lower...”
So Baby Elephant bent
down lower, until…

##
“Snap!” Her nose was
in the jaws of Crocodile.
“Crocodile will eat you
for dinner!” squawked
Crow.

##
Baby Elephant sat back
on her strong legs and
pulled, and pulled, and
pulled.
But Crocodile did not let
go.

##
Baby Elephant's nose
stretched, and
stretched, and
stretched, until…
“Duuffff!” she fell on
her back.

##
Cross at losing his
dinner, Crocodile
slithered back into the
water.

##
Baby Elephant looked
at her nose.
She could not see
where it ended!

##
It was so long she could
pick fruit from high
branches.

##
And shower herself with
water on a hot day.

##
And to this day, all
elephants have very
long and useful trunks.
