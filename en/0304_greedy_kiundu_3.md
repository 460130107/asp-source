# Greedy Kiundu

##
A long time ago, in the village
of Nyamani, there lived a man
known as Kiundu.
He liked to eat meat a lot.

##
One day, the chief of Nyamani
village invited all the villagers
to his son's wedding.

##
Kiundu also heard that there
was another wedding party in
Katumbi village.
“Ugh! Two parties on the same
day!” Kiundu thought.

##
“I must attend both parties,”
Kiundu said.
“I will first walk to Katumbi then
come back to Nyamani.”

##
Kiundu woke up early in the
morning and walked to Katumbi
village.
He looked around and saw that
the party had not yet started.
“I will go back to Nyamani and
return to Katumbi later,” Kiundu
decided.

##
Kiundu walked back to Nyamani
hoping to find the meat ready.
He was now very hungry.
When he arrived, men were still
preparing the food.

##
“I left cooks at Katumbi
preparing to cook,” he thought.
“The food must be ready now.”
Kiundu decided to go back to
Katumbi.

##
When Kiundu arrived at the
Katumbi party, people had
already eaten.
Guests were giving presents to
the bride and the groom.
Kiundu was very mean.
He did not have a present to
give. He only wanted to eat.

##
Kiundu was very disappointed
about missing the food.
He decided to walk back to
Nyamani village.
Because he was hungry and
tired, he could not walk fast.

##
When he arrived at Nyamani
village, people were singing and
dancing.
They had already eaten all the
food.

##
Upon hearing that there was no
food, Kiundu fell and fainted.
He had missed meat from both
parties.
All he got was some porridge in
a small cup.

##
Slowly, he walked home sad
and hungry.
