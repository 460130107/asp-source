# Grandmother and the Smelly Girl

##
Tasneem was a very beautiful girl
and her grandmother was very
kind.

##
Her grandmother spent many hours
making a handsome makgabe for
Tasneem. Tasneem loved to wear
that apron.

##
The other girls in that place were
jealous of Tasneem's makgabe.
They thought that it would be better
to get rid of it.
But it is a difficult thing to take a
person's clothes when that person
is wearing them.

##
One morning the girls invited
Tasneem to go swimming with them
in a river nearby. At the river bank,
they all took off their makgabes so
that the cloth would not be
damaged.
Then they jumped into the water
and splashed around for some time.

##
They finished swimming. The leader
of the jealous girls threw Tasneem's
makgabe into the river, near the
place of a very large snake. Then all
the other girls left Tasneem crying
by the river.

##
The large snake heard someone
weeping. He slithered out and saw
the beautiful Tasneem. He
swallowed the makgabe and
Tasneem whole.

##
Fortunately for her, the snake did
not like the taste of the makgabe.
He spat it and Tasneem out. They
lay on the river bank, covered with
slime from the snake's stomach.
This slime smelled very bad.

##
The smelly Tasneem put on her
smelly makgabe and ran home to
her parents.
She sang …

Mother, open the door for me, I am smelling;
Mother, open the door for me, I am smelling,
I am smelling very bad.
The mother heard Tasneem's song and ran out of the house.
She sang back to the girl:
Go away, you are smelling,
Go away, you are smelling,
Go away, you are smelling very bad.

##
Tasneem was very upset.
She ran off to the house of her aunt
and uncle.
They heard her singing …

Open the door for me, I am smelling;
Open the door for me, I am smelling,
I am smelling very bad.
They ran out of their house. They sang back:
Go away, you are smelling,
Go away, you are smelling,
Go away, you are smelling very bad.

##
Tasneem had only her
grandmother's house to go to. Her
heart was heavy. She thought
nobody wanted to look after a bad
smelling girl.

##
But she was wrong. Her
grandmother did not send her away.
She washed Tasneem, and her
makgabe, making everything smell
sweetly.

##
Tasneem stayed with her
grandmother for many years.
One day the son of a very rich chief
asked Tasneem to marry him.

##
Tasneem's parents heard about the
marriage and asked her to come
back to live in their house.

##
Tasneem remembered how she had
smelled so bad.
She told them that she would never
go back to their house.
"Parents must love their children,"
she said, "even if their children
smell very bad."

##
Instead Tasneem invited her
grandmother to come and live with
her in the house of this rich chief
and his son.

##
The grandmother was very happy, and very comfortable, and very important.
