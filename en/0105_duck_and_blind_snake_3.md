# Duck and Blind snake

##
Duck and Blind snake were friends.
But they were always competing
with each other. One day they
decided to play football to see who
the best player was.

##
They went to the football field and
started their game. Duck was fast,
but Blind snake was faster. Duck
kicked far, but Blind snake kicked
further. Duck started to feel
grumpy.

##
They decided to play a penalty
shoot-out. First Blind snake was
goal keeper. Duck scored only one
goal. Then it was the Duck's turn to
defend the goal.

##
Blind snake kicked the ball and
scored.Blind snake dribbled the ball
and scored. Blind snake headed the
ball and scored. Blind snake scored
five goals.

##
Duck was furious that she lost. She
was a very bad loser. Blind snake
started laughing because his friend
was making such a fuss.

##
Duck was so angry that she opened
her beak wide and swallowed the
Blind snake.

##
As Duck was walking home, she
met Mother Blind snake. Mother
Blind snake asked, “Have you seen
my child?” Duck didn't say
anything.
Mother Blind snake was worried.

##
Then Mother Blind snake heard a
tiny voice. “Help me mom!” cried
the voice. Mother Blind snake
looked around and listened
carefully. The voice came from
inside the Duck.

##
Mother Blind snake shouted, “Use
your special power my child!” Blind
snakecan make a bad smell and a
terrible taste. Duck began to feel ill.

##
Duck burped. Then she swallowed
and spat. Then she sneezed and
coughed. And coughed. The Blind
snake was disgusting!

##
Duck coughed until she coughed
out the Blind snake that was in her
stomach. Mother Blind snake and
her child crawled up a tree to hide.

##
From that time, Ducks and Blind
snake were enemies.
