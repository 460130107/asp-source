# Lion is sick

##
One day, all the wild animals
got together to choose a king.
They decided that Lion should
be their king.

##
In celebration of the new king,
they had a great big party that
went on for a week. They ate,
they drank, they sang and they
danced.

##
When the celebration was over,
everyone went home.

##
King Lion went home too.
The next day, when Hyena
arrived at Lion's house to visit
the king, he found Lion was sick
in bed.
Lion said weakly, “I have got a
terrible illness. I don't know
what to do.”

##
Hyena said, “O great king, don't
worry. Hare will know the cure
for this illness.”

The reason he said this was because he wanted to get Hare
into trouble with the king. Hyena knew that Hare would not
be able to cure Lion's illness.

##
Lion cheered up and right away
sent Hyena to call Hare.

##
Hyena ran to call Hare and said,
“Let's go to the king because he
is very sick. He sent me to call
you.”

So Hare hurried to Lion's house.

##
Lion said, “I am so happy to
see, my dear Hare. I have called
you because my life is hanging
by a thread. I have an incurable
illness. Hyena told me that you
have the cure for this sickness
of mine.”

And Hare replied, “You are correct, O king. I am able to heal
this illness. But the medicine is very difficult to get a hold
of.”

##
Lion replied, “Don't you worry,
Hare, about this medicine being
difficult to find. The bird that
flies is the one that is caught.
Come on now, tell us about this
medicine!”

##
And Hare replied, “O my king,
when I say that the medicine is
hard to find I don't mean that it
is far away. For you to be healed
at once, you must make an
ointment from the heart of a
hyena.”

##
When Hyena heard that, he
started trembling all over. He
was the one who had told Lion
that Hare had the medicine to
cure his illness! It was useless
now to try to contradict Hare
about the medicine.

##
So Hyena ran away.
And to this day, hyenas like to
eat hares, but always avoid
lions.
