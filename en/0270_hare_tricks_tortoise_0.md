# Hare Tricks Tortoise

##
Once upon a time, there lived a tortoise, who had worked
very hard during his entire life.

##
When he retired, he received a nice lump sum of money.

##
He decided that he would buy a big piece of land with the
money, and become a farmer.

##
News spread all over the village that Tortoise was looking for
land to buy.

##
When Hare heard the news, he had an idea! He rushed to
see Tortoise and said:

"Mr Tortoise! I can help you find land to buy. Come with me!"

##
That very same day, Hare took Tortoise to visit a plot. He
pointed to a large field and said:

"I own all this land!"

##
Tortoise was impressed.
After bargaining for a while, they agreed on
a price and Tortoise paid for the land.

##
The next day, Tortoise got up bright and early. He gathered
some of his friends together and they went with their tools to
visit the farm. They wanted to prepare it for planting.

##
When they reached, all they could see was water!
"Where is your land?" they asked, unable to contain their
laughter.

##
Tortoise realised that he
had been tricked.
Hare had sold him a
beach, and when the
tide came in, all that
was left was the sea.
There was no farm land.

##
Tortoise went straight away to see Elephant, who was the
highest judge in the land, and told him what had happened.

Elephant ordered lion to go and find Hare and bring him to
the court.

##
When Hare heard lion coming, he
ran out and said: "I am so happy to
see you lion, but I have to run. Wild
dogs have invaded our village!"

As soon as he was out of sight,
Hare ran from house to house,
howling like a wild dog.

##
Lion could hear the howling wild dogs coming from all
directions, and shaking with fear, he ran away.

##
And hare too ran away,
with all of Tortoises
money!

Tortoise was sad, but he
had many friends who
helped him find another
piece of land to farm.
