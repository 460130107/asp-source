# Mulongo and the ogre

##
A long time ago, there lived a man
called Mulongo and his wife
Nambuya. They had two children,
Mukhwana and Namono. There was
a famine in the land where they
lived. All the villagers, including
Mulongo and his family, would leave
their homes early to look for food in
the forest.

##
One day, Mulongo, his wife and
children decided to go deep in the
forest in search of something to eat.
From morning to evening they
looked for food but they found
nothing. Nambuya urged her
husband to go further into the
forest. Mulongo led the way as
Nambuya and the two children
followed.

##
Suddenly Mulongo saw a beautiful
banana plantation. He called his
wife and said, “Is that not a banana
plantation? I can see bananas and
other food crops. I wonder whose it
is.” They moved on and soon saw a
house in the middle of the
plantation. They stopped, looked in
all directions, but there was no one
around. Because they were hungry
and it was nearly night time, they
decided to sit and wait for the
owner.

##
Suddenly they heard heavy
breathing close to the house. They
were frightened to see a huge ogre
arrive. “Who are you and what do
you want?” asked the ogre in a
fearful voice. Mulongo in a
trembling voice said, “We came
looking for food because there is
famine in our place.” The ogre gave
them food.

##
For several days the ogre allowed
Mulongo and his family to eat his
crops without asking for anything in
return. One morning, however, the
ogre said to Nambuya, “I want you
to cook your son for me to eat when
I come back this evening.” When
the ogre had gone Mulongo went
into the bush and killed some small
animals, which he asked his wife to
cook for the ogre. Meanwhile he
asked Mukhwana to climb up a leafy
mango tree and hide.

##
In the evening the ogre returned
and asked, “Have you cooked
Mukhwana for me?” Mulongo's wife
answered, “Yes.” She gave the ogre
the meat and he greedily ate
everything. Then he said,
“Tomorrow you cook your
daughter.”

##
The following morning Mulongo and
his wife did as they had done on the
first day. Namono was hidden up
the mango tree. When the ogre
returned he said, “Did you cook
Namono?” Again, Nambuya told the
ogre that she had done so.

##
After eating, the ogre instructed
Nambuya to cook her husband
Mulongo, the next day. Nambuya
was perturbed but Mulongo said he
would go out again and catch some
animals to cook. He did that and
after giving the meat to his wife, he
also climbed up the mango tree to
hide.

##
At dusk the ogre came back.
Nambuya gave the meat to the
ogre who enjoyed it very much. He
told Nambuya, “Tomorrow cook
yourself.” When the ogre had left
Nambuya called her husband to
advise her. Mulongo said, “Go and
look for some small animals and
cook them for the ogre. When
everything is ready, come up the
tree where we are.”

##
The ogre came back in the
afternoon and started eating his
tasty evening meal of sweet meat.
He felt sleepy, went to lie under the
mango tree and began snoring. But
not so long after, the ogre woke up
because he heard noises above
him. The ogre looked up to the tree
and saw Mulongo and his wife and
children.

##
The ogre was very angry. “So you
deceived me? Let me come and get
you,” he shouted.
As the ogre was struggling to climb
up the tree, Mulongo quickly
thought of a trick and said, “It will
be easier for you to reach us if you
tie a rope around your neck and we
help to pull you up.”

##
The ogre ran into the house,
brought a strong rope and after
tying it around his neck he threw
the other end of the rope to
Mulongo. Mulongo and his wife and
children started pulling the ogre up
as they twisted the rope. The rope
soon tightened around the ogre's
neck until he could not breathe and
died. Mulongo and his family came
down the tree and took over the
ogre's house and property.
