# Animals dig a well
Um conto tradicional dos Manyungwes de Moçambique

##
It happened one year that the rain didn't fall. The trees dried up and died. The rivers
disappeared and the water evaporated. People and animals began dying from hunger and
thirst.

##
Lion and Elephant as the chief animals got together to discuss the situation. Lion said,
“We're going to end up dying from thirst. Let's call everyone together and discuss the idea
of digging a well. Elephant agreed and went off to spread the news to all the animals.

##
All the animals except the hare got together to discuss the situation. Lion said, “Look, my
brothers and sisters, this year, the rain has not fallen. Everyone is dying from hunger and
thirst. Let us now make a plan to dig a well so that we might all be able to drink from it.”

##
All the animals agreed and immediately grabbed hoes, shovels and picks and started
digging. They dug and dug. And they dug some more. Finally they hit water. Lion said, “Why
did Hare not come to dig this well? He most certainly will not drink from this water!”

##
Later Hare came and saw the well. He said, “Tipite, tipite at the well!” He heard nothing. So
he went in, drank some water and splashed around for a while.

##
The next day, when the animals came they saw that their well was a big mess. The water
was nothing but mud. They asked, “Who would do such a thing?” Someone said, “I bet it
was Hare. When we were digging the well he was nowhere to be found.”

##
And so the animals decided to leave a guard at the well. They
chose Baboon to keep an eye on things. Baboon was at the well
when Hare came at night saying, “Tipite! Tipite! by the water!”
Baboon replied, “Pitani!” So Hare came over and greeted Baboon,
“I have come, my friend, and I bring that which the great ones like
to eat!” Baboon replied, “Come, let's see what it is.”

##
Hare had some honey. He went over to Baboon, “Yes, my friend, try some of this!” Hare
gave him the honey. Then he drew some water from the well and drank it. Just as Hare was
leaving, Hyena arrived and he saw Hare.

##
The next day, Hyena went and told all the animals that Hare had taken water from the well.
So they chose Turtle to guard the well. Hare arrived at night, saying, “Tipite by the well!”
When he didn't hear any reply he said: “I am Hare! I've come to drink water.”

##
When Turtle had arrived at the well earlier that night, she had hidden herself among the
rocks. She looked just like another rock. As soon as Hare started to go into the water, Turtle
grabbed Hare by the leg. Turtle didn't say a word, she just sat there holding on until the sun
came up.

##
When the animals arrived, they saw that Turtle had captured Hare. They called the rest of
the animals to decide what to do with Hare. When all the animals were assembled, Lion
asked them, “What shall we do with this Hare?”

##
Turtle said, “Elephant should grab him with her trunk and beat him on the rocks.” All the
other animals agreed. Then Hare said, “O Great Lion, you know that hares don't die if you
hit them on rocks. The Hare will only die if he is thrown into ash.” So Lion told Elephant to
throw Hare into ash.

##
After Hare was completely covered with ash, Elephant picked him up and threw him. When
Hare landed he made a big cloud of dust. The dust was everywhere.

##
When the dust settled, the animals
looked around. Hare was gone!
They realised that Hare had tricked
them again.
