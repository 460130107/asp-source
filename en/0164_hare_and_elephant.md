# Hare and Elephant

##
Long, long time ago, there lived
Hare and Elephant.
Hare was clever and cunning.
Elephant was slow and vain.

##
One day, Hare went to the
market and bought a pair of
beautiful shoes made of iron.
On his way home, Hare met
Elephant.
Elephant liked Hare's shoes so
much that he asked Hare to
take him to the place where he
bought them.

##
Hare said to Elephant, “You
should get a better pair than
mine, that way you can show
off to the whole village and
make others jealous.”
Elephant was so excited.
Hare and Elephant agreed to
meet the next day at Hare's
home.

##
The following day, Elephant
went to Hare's house.
Hare said to him, “Welcome my
friend, come in so we can get
you the best pair of shoes that
no one else has.”

##
Elephant was surprised and
said, “Excuse me my friend, I
thought we were going to the
market to buy the shoes?”
Hare answered and said,
“Elephant, do you want the
shoes or is it the market that
you want to see?”

##
Elephant calmed down and
said, “Of course I want shoes.
I did not sleep last night
because I was thinking of my
new shoes all the time.”

So Hare led Elephant to the
back of the house where he had
lit a huge fire.
Hare said to Elephant, “Stand in
the fire so that the shoes can
start forming.”

##
Because Elephant was eager to
have the shoes, he did as Hare
said.
At first he did not mind the heat
of the fire.
Then Elephant's hooves began
to burn. He felt a lot of pain but
because he wanted beautiful
shoes, he did not move.
As the pain increased, Elephant
started to cry.

##
Hare said to Elephant, “Stop
crying otherwise the shoes will
be ugly.”
Elephant quietened down a
little but the pain increased.
While tears rolled down
Elephant's face, Hare secretly
laughed and said, “Stop crying
if you want the shoes.”

##
When the pain was too much to
put up with, Elephant jumped
out of the fire.
Unfortunately, his hooves had
already burned so he could not
walk.
He lay down roaring with pain.

##
Hare went close to Elephant's
ear and whispered,
“You were so close to having
the most beautiful pair of
shoes, but now you cannot have
them.”

##
It was many months before
Elephant could stand up
because his hooves were so
badly burnt.
They were flat.
When he managed to walk, he
was limping.

##
He limped all the way to his
home where his wife and
children were waiting for him in
tears.
To this day, Elephant still limps
and his hooves are flat.
