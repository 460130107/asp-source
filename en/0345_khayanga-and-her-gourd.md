# Khayanga and her Gourd

##
Khayanga lived with her parents
happily until they died when she
was ten years old.

##
Khayanga was taken in by Rosa, a
distant relative.
Rosa was kind to Khayanga, but she
was old, frail and poor.

##
Khayanga often visited her parents'
graves to tell them of her misery.

##
One day when she visited, she
received a gift. It was a very special
Gourd which appeared from her
parents' graves.

##
The Gourd sang a beautiful and
soothing song. Khayanga
recognised the voice as that of her
late mother.
It went like this...

Khayanga, ee, Khayanga!
Our child the loved one!
You're not alone, loved one!
Have this gourd, loved one!
Carry it everywhere you go, loved one!
Let it console you loved one!

##
Khayanga carried her special Gourd
everywhere.
With her Gourd, Khayanga felt her
parents' presence and protection.

##
One day, something bad happened
to her special Gourd. It broke when
she was fetching water in the river.
Khayanga's heart broke as well.

##
Khayanga held the pieces of the
broken Gourd in her small hands
and sang:

Father and Mother,
See the gourd is broken.
The gourd you gave me.
What do I do, Mother and Father?
Be kind and show me a sign...
That you are still with me.

##
Khayanga heard her mother's voice
saying to her:
"Our child, pick up the pieces that
are left.
Fetch water with them and wash
your feet.
When you finish washing, close your
eyes."
Khayanga obeyed and suddenly,
the broken Gourd became whole
once again.

##
Khayanga continued to carry her
Gourd everywhere she went.
Wherever she passed, people
whispered to each other, “What
type of gourd is this?”
With her special Gourd, Khayanga
received everything she needed.

##
With the special Gourd, Khayanga
knew that her parents were
watching over her.
Nothing bad could happen to her.
