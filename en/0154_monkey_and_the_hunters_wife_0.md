# Monkey and the hunter's wife

##
In Miwa Forest, there lived
Monkey who was always sad.
Every time she had a baby, it
died.

##
The pain of losing her babies
made Monkey jump up and
down.
She would jump to one branch,
then to another, and cry out,
“Kwi! Kwi! Kwi!”

##
Monkey was always sad.
She was sadder when she saw
other monkey parents with their
babies.

##
The sad Monkey would sit on a
branch and look up!
Days passed and Monkey cried
more and more.

##
Then she gave birth again.
She decided to take the baby to
the path so that people passing
by would see the baby and wish
it well.

##
Monkey climbed down from the
branch and put the baby on the
path.
At that time, a hunter was
returning home.
He saw the baby monkey lying
on the side of the path.

##
The hunter carried the baby
monkey to his house.
When the hunter reached
home, his three boys wanted to
hold the baby monkey.

##
The three boys played singing:
“Throw it up!
Throw it down!
Throw it to me!
Throw it to him!”
The baby monkey was thrown
from one child to the other.

##
As the three boys played with
the baby monkey, mother
Monkey was hiding in a tree
watching.
She was afraid that this baby
would also die like the others.

##
Then the hunter's wife came
and saw her children playing
with the little monkey.
She said, “Be careful! Bring it
here. You will drop it!”

##
She took the baby monkey in
her arms, and blessed it.

##
The hunter's wife put the baby
monkey down.
Mother Monkey held her baby
to her chest.
She disappeared up the tree.
She never lost another baby!
