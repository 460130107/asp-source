# My first day at the market

##
I live in Kakuma village, a very hot
dry place, full of thorny trees, and
more goats than people.
Even the market place is quiet, with
only a few small shops. Most people
use bicycles for transport.

##
One morning my mother called me and said, "Etabo,
today you turn six years old. We have a present for
you."
"What is it? What is it?" I asked eagerly.
"Tomorrow we're going by bus to the market in
Eldoret," she replied, "And we're taking you with us!"
My first visit to the city! I was so excited that I could
hardly sleep that night.

##
The next day at the Kakuma bus
stop, I stood between my mother
and my aunt in my new pair of blue
jeans and red T-shirt.
I felt very small between my tall
slender mother and my big round
aunt.

##
The bus was very full, so I had to sit
on my mother's lap.
Tired from the heat and excitement,
I slept the whole way and saw
nothing.

##
The sun was just rising when we reached Eldoret
market.
At the entrance was a woman selling grains. Over in
one corner there were two men getting ready to lay
out their sweet potatoes.
Over in another corner was a short woman holding a
shiny blue helicopter.
"Mother, mother, look at that helicopter!" But
mother pulled me away.

##
In the middle of the market, there was a large stall
that sold different types of fruit.
Some of them I had never seen before.
"What are the names of these fruits?" I asked my
mother. She pointed at some: "These are oranges,
and these are guavas."
I turned around and said, "And these?"

##
Of all the fruits at the stall, I liked
the apples most. I liked their shape
and colour. I wondered how they
tasted.
I turned to mother and said, "Could
you buy one for me?"

##
As soon as she gave me the apple, I
let go of my mother's hand, took
the fruit with both hands, and bit
into the juicy flesh.
I had never enjoyed a fruit the way I
enjoyed that apple.
All I cared about was my apple.

##
When I finished the apple, I looked up to talk to my
mother. But she was not there! I looked where we
had come from, but my mother and aunt were not
there.
I looked to the right, then to the left. But they were
nowhere to be seen. "Have you seen my mother?" I
asked the women selling potatoes nearby. They took
no notice. I started to cry.

##
A while later, a woman took me by
the hand and led me to a place
where there were other children.
A big man with a thick beard asked,
"What's your name, boy?"
"E-ta-bo," I replied through my
tears.

##
I wondered if children were also
sold at the market. I stopped crying
and looked around to see if anyone
would buy the children in the room.
Soon a woman came in and picked
up one of the children.
"I will be the next one to be taken
away," I thought. "And then I'll
never go home again!"
I started crying once more.

##
When I heard the big man with the
thick beard saying, "Where is
Etabo?" I cried even harder.
"But I do not want to go with you!" I
sobbed.
I ran away from him.

##
When my mother and aunt heard
my name, they rushed to the room.
"Etabo, Etabo!" a familiar voice
called.
It was my mother.

##
As I got up to hug my mother, my
aunt said, "Etabo, we were looking
for you to give you your birthday
present."
And from a big bag, she pulled out a
shiny blue helicopter.
"It's yours!" she said.
