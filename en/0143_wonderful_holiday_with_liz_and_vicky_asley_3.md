# Wonderful holiday with Liz and Vicky Asley

##
Once upon a time there lived a girl called
Vicky, She had her friend called Liz. Liz was
an American lady. Liz loved Vicky so much
and Vicky liked Liz very much. One day,
when Vicky was at school breaking up for
her holidays, Liz visited her at school and
gave her the good news about their visit at
the World Life Education Center. Vicky was
very excited that she hugged Liz with joy.

The following day, Vicky packed her things
she needed for camping. They boarded a
bus to World Life Education Center. When
they reached there, they saw wonderful
things like monkeys, gorillas, lions, snakes
and so many others. Since that, Vicky
realized how wonderful that holiday was
with Liz! THE END.
