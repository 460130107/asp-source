# Why hippos have no hair

##
One day, Rabbit was walking by
the riverside.

##
Hippo was there too, going for a
stroll and eating some nice
green grass.

##
Hippo didn't see that Rabbit
was there and she accidentally
stepped on Rabbit's foot.
Rabbit yelled and started
screaming at Hippo, “You
Hippo! Can't you see that
you're stepping on my foot?”

##
Hippo apologised to Rabbit,
“I'm so sorry, my friend. I didn't
see you. Please forgive me!”
But Rabbit wouldn't listen and
he shouted at Hippo, “You did
that on purpose! Someday,
you'll see! You're going to pay!”

##
Then Rabbit went to find Fire and he said, “Go, burn Hippo when she comes out
of the water to eat grass. She stepped on me!”
Fire answered, “No problem, Rabbit, my friend. I'll do just what you asked.”

##
Later, Hippo was eating grass
far from the river when
“whoosh!” Fire burst into flame.
The flames began to burn
Hippo's hair.

##
Hippo started to cry and ran for
the water. All her hair was
burned in the fire.
Hippo kept crying, “My hair has
burned in the fire! You burned
all my hair! My hair is all gone!
My beautiful beautiful hair!”

##
That's why the hippo never goes far from the water for fear of getting burned by
Fire.
Hare was very happy when Hippo got burned, saying, “I got her back!”
