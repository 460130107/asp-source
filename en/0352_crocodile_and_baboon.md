# Crocodile and Baboon

##
Baboon and Crocodile were the
best of friends. They played
together. They ate together.
They did everything together.

##
But one day, Crocodile got so
sick that he was almost dead.
When he saw that his sickness
was getting worse, Crocodile
went to the nyabezi who said,
“If you want to get better, you
have to eat baboon meat.”

##
When he heard this, Crocodile
was sad. But there was no other
option to heal himself except to
eat his friend the baboon.

##
When Baboon went to see his
friend, Crocodile put him on his
back and took him out to the
deepest part of the river.

##
Crocodile said, “The nyabezi
told me that if I am to be healed
I must eat you, my friend.”

##
Then, Baboon replied, “No, my
friend. Don't eat me. I'm too
small. Wait a minute and I'll call
my grandfather. He's bigger
than me. Eat him and you'll be
full.”

##
Then Crocodile said, “Where is
this grandfather of yours?”
Baboon said, “He's in that tree,
over on that island.” Crocodile
said, “Go get him so that I may
eat him.”

##
Baboon jumped off Crocodile's
back and ran straight up the
tree and stayed there. Crocodile
waited and waited. But he
didn't see any sign of Baboon.
And that was the end of their
friendship.
