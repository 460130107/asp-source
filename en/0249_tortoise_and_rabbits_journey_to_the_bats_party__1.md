# Tortoise and rabbits' JOURNEY to the bats' party

##
The journey started at 8:00 am. On the way to
the bats party, tortoise told the rabbit that
once they reach at the party, he will be called
“All of you” and rabbit accepted it.

##
By 10:00am they were already at the party,
warmly welcomed by the bats and given seats
in one room.

##
The bats brought tea for them and tortoise
asked who should take the tea? The bats
replied “it is for all of you”.

##
Tortoise thanked the bats and he started taking
the tea alone since he was called all of you at
the party.

##
When Time for lunch came, food was served.
The bats again said, “This food is for all of
you”. Immediately Tortoise began eating as the
rabbit waited for his food.

##
Unfortunately the bats did not know that
tortoise was called all of you and the Bats
found out later that the rabbit did not eat when
they came for plates. This shocked the bats
because the food was over.

##
The rabbit then moved out running as tortoise
and the bats enjoyed the party.

##
Ever since then, tortoise walks slowly because
of the food that he ate at the party, bats swing
in the air because they are afraid of rabbit's
hunger and rabbit runs so fast because he has
to find food to eat somewhere else.
