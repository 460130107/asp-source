# Hare the trickster

##
One day, Hare was out looking for food. He met Elephant, who had a pot of honey. Hare asked Elephant, "Please be kind and carry me. I am weak."

##
Elephant agreed to carry Hare. Hare got onto Elephant's back and held on tightly. He started eating Elephant's honey straight away!

##
Honey began dripping on Elephant's back. When Elephant asked what it was, Hare said that it was from his wound.

##
They reached a river and found a large buffalo drinking water.

##
Hare wanted to know who was stronger, Buffalo or Elephant.

##
They began arguing. Elephant said she was stronger and Buffalo said she was stronger.

##
Hare said he had an idea how to find out who was stronger. He asked them to wait for him there.

##
Hare came back with a long rope. He tied the one end around Elephant's waist and led her away from the river.

##
Hare tied the other end of the rope around Buffalo's waist and left her near the river.

##
Hare ran and hid himself in a tree. He shouted, "Ready! One, two, three! Pull!"

##
Buffalo and Elephant pulled. Elephant pulled Buffalo.

##
Buffalo pulled Elephant. Neither could win.

##
From where he was hiding, Hare continued to eat Elephant's honey.

##
After he had finished the honey, he cut the rope closer to Buffalo.

##
Elephant fell over hard and hit a tree.

##
Hare went to Buffalo and praised her, saying that she was stronger.
