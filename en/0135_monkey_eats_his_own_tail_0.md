# Monkey Eats his Own Tail

##
Once upon a time the
rabbit was a great
friend of the monkey.

##
One day the rabbit
said:
Let's go for a walk
and look for
something to eat.
The monkey agreed,
but it was a trap for
him!

##
They went to a field of
maize and started to
eat it.

##
But the clever rabbit
had spoken to the
owners of the farm, to
catch the monkey and
show him he was
foolish.

##
The clever rabbit
started shouting:
Robbers! Robbers!
Your maize is all gone!
And he jumped up and
ran away.

##
Suddenly the owners
appeared and found
the monkey trying to
run away. But he has a
long tail and it was
stopping him.

##
The owners followed
him, shouting:
Stop! Stop!
We saw you, you are
the monkey.

##
But they caught him
and started beating
him.

##
He couldn't stand the
pain so he said:
I was with my friend
rabbit. He is the one
who invited me.

##
But the owners cut his
tail off and told him:
Go and tell your friend
that we cut off your tail!

##
Then they went to the
rabbit's house and
cooked the monkey's
tail to eat.
The rabbit invited the
monkey for lunch.

##
At the end of the meal
the rabbit asked the
monkey if he knew
what he had eaten.
The foolish monkey
answered: No, I don't!

##
The rabbit told him that
he had eaten his own
tail and then ran away.
And from then on they
became enemies!
