# Rats!

##
There was a man who sold oil
that he made in his house.

##
And in that house there
were rats. Lots of rats!

##
Every day the rats looked
at the oil and said, "How
can we get that oil?"

##
The rats tried to put their
mouths into the bottles. But the
spaces in the bottles were too
small.

##
The rats tried to tip over the bottles. But the oil would not flow out.

##
The rats had a meeting to
discuss the problem. After a
while, one rat said, "Let's put
our tails into the bottles. Then
we can lick the oil off our tails."

##
And that's exactly what the rats did. They put their tails into the bottles,
and then licked the oil off each other's tails. The rats did this until they
had licked up all the oil.

##
The man of the house saw
that all his oil was gone!

##
And that was the end of it.
