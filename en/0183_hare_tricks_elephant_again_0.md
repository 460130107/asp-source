# Hare tricks Elephant again

##
Once upon a time,
Elephant and Hare were
very good friends.
They shared a large herd
of camels, cattle, and sheep.

##
They grazed their animals
in the valley of Kingilo.
Sometimes they took
the animals to the hills,
where there was plenty
of grass and water.

##
As the animals grazed,
Hare and Elephant played
games.
They enjoyed playing
football very much.

##
Every time they played,
Elephant would score
more goals than Hare.
This upset Hare very much.

##
One day Hare asked Elephant,
“What makes you so good?”
Elephant quickly answered,
“My big legs.”

##
The next day,
Hare suggested that
they run a race.
Elephant agreed and
they started their race.

##
Hare won all the races.
Elephant was upset
because he had never
been defeated.
So he asked Hare,
“What makes you a
good runner?”
Hare answered,
“My thin legs.”

##
Without a second thought,
Elephant asked what
he could do to make
his legs thin.
Hare said, “It is simple,
I will show you with fire.”

##
Hare said, “Put your legs
in the fire.”
Elephant stepped into
the fire. He shouted,
“I am burning! I am
burning!”

##
Hare was happy.
He encouraged Elephant
to hold on, because burning
his legs was the only way
they could become thin.

##
Elephant's legs hurt very badly,
so he crawled out of the fire.
He could not stand with his
burned legs, so he lay down.

##
Elephant sat for many
days before he could
stand on his legs.

##
Eventually, he was able
to limp home to his family.

##
Hare and Elephant are
no longer friends.
