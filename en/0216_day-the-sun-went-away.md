# Day the sun went away

##
Mother Sun decided to visit her sister, the moon.

Sister Moon lives on the other side of the sky. “I will be back soon,” said Sun to the clouds.

##
When Sun left, the mountains put on their white scarves.

##
Wind had an argument with the trees.

The trees became angry.

They threw their leaves all over the place.

##
The sky started to grumble.

She turned grey.

##
The clouds were sad to see all this.

They started crying.

There were many tears.

##
The whole world began to sink under water.

##
Meanwhile, on the other side of the sky,

Sun was ready to leave her sister.

She kissed the moon goodbye and went home.

##
Sky was so happy to see Sun that she turned bright blue.

The mountains put on their pretty green dresses.

##
The wind went to sleep.

The trees stretched their branches and smiled.

##
The clouds were very happy to see mother Sun again.

They went away to play.

##
Lots of little plants popped out of the earth to say, “Hello.”

The whole world sparkled.

##
Mother Sun shone her light everywhere.“I told you I would be back,” she beamed.
