# Friends become enemies

##
Once upon a time there lived
two friends, Hyena and Hare.
Hyena was a hardworking
farmer. He woke up early every
morning and went to work in his
field.

##
Hare woke up when it was
already broad daylight. He
would yawn and stretch. Then
he would go looking for food.

##
Most mornings, Hare would take
some seeds from Hyena's
granary. Then he went to his
field and pretended to work. He
would light a fire and roast the
seeds. He did nothing, except
eat roasted seeds.

##
At harvest time, Hare went and
stole his friend's ripe maize. He
carried it to his own granary.

##
Hyena complained about the
stolen crops. Hare answered,
“Maybe the neighbours stole
your maize. They are suffering
from famine because they are
lazy.”

##
Hyena thought about this
problem for a long time. He
came up with an idea.
He collected gum from the
trees. He put that sticky gum
around the whole field. The
thief would get stuck in the
gum.

##
During the night, Hare went to
Hyena's field to steal more
maize. Before entering the field
he looked around to see if it
was safe.

##
Hare did not see the gum that
Hyena had put around the field.
Hare stood in the gum and was
stuck. He started shouting for
help.

##
Hyena heard the shouts and ran
out to catch the thief.
He could not believe his eyes. It
was his friend Hare who was
stuck in the gum!

##
From that time, Hyena went his way and Hare went the
other way.
That marked the end of their friendship.
