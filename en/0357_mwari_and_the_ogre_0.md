# Mwari and the ogre

##
Once upon a time there lived a young girl
called Mwari.

##
Her parents used to send her to collect
firewood near the forest,but with caution not to
go inside the forest for the forest was full of
dangerous animals and ogres.

##
As she looked inside the forest she saw a big
dry log lying on the ground. One day Mwari
went to collect firewood as usual.

##
She took the axe and entered into the forest.
As she started cutting the fallen tree into
pieces she heard a big sound asking,” who is
touching my firewood?”

##
Mwari was so scared, she tried
to run but the ogre grabbed her
by hand.

##
It told her she will make it's lunch meal by
boiling in a big pot.

##
Her screams alerted other villagers who had
come to collect firewood too

##
They ran back to the village and
informed the village warriors
who went to the forest to fight
the ogre.

##
Although many of them were
injured they managed to rescue
her.

##
She learnt her lesson to obey
what she was told.
