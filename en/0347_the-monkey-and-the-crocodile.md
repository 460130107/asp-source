# The Monkey and the Crocodile

##
A monkey lived in a big
tree on the bank of a
river. In the middle of
the river there was a
small island. Lots of
fruit trees grew on that
island.

##
The monkey wanted to
go and eat the fruit. He
saw a big rock half way
across the river and he
thought he could jump
onto the rock, and then
onto the island.

##
He jumped into the air
and landed on the rock.
He jumped again and
reached the island. He
enjoyed eating the fruit
and then went back
home. He did this
several times.

##
But a crocodile lived in
the river with his wife!
The wife said, "Dear
husband, you should go
and lie on the rock. The
colour of your skin
matches the colour of
the rock."

##
A few days later, the
crocodile saw the
monkey coming onto
the island. He quietly
climbed over the rock
and carefully lay down
on it and kept his face
underwater.

##
The monkey finished
eating and was ready to
go back. But the rock
looked higher than
usual, so he spoke to
the rock, "Dear rock,
you seem to have
grown. Are you all
right?"

##
The crocodile was a fool
and thought the rock
must be a talking rock.
So he answered the
monkey and said, "I
look bigger because a
big crocodile is lying on
me".

##
The monkey said, "Dear
crocodile, I know you
want to eat me. I am
very old and you can
have my body. But I
must say goodbye to
my children in that big
tree." So the crocodile
gave him a ride on his
back!

##
As soon as they were
there, the monkey
climbed the tree and
said, “Thank you for the
ride, my dear friend.
Goodbye, now you can
go home!" But the
crocodile said, "But you
promised…."

##
The monkey laughed
and said, "What a fool
you were to believe
me!" and disappeared
behind the branches of
the tree. The crocodile
never did catch that
clever monkey!
