# Monkey's visit to the hunters home.

##
In Nakwiga Forest, there lived
Monkey who was always lonely but
friendly.
she had miscarriages most times
baby.

##
The pain of having miscarriages
made Monkey jump up and down all
the time.
She would jump from one tree to
another saying “Kau! Kau! Kau!”

##
Monkey was always lonely.
She could feel bad when saw other
monkeys playing with their babies
on their backs.

##
The lonely Monkey would sway this
way and that way.
She would sway on this branch and
on that branch!
She would sway on this tree and the
other tree!
Days passed and Monkey cried
more and more.

##
Then she conceived again and gave
birth.
She decided to take the baby to the
path so that people passing by
going to the river would see the
baby and wish it well.

##
Monkey climbed down from the
branch and put the baby on the
path and climbed up and sat in
between the branches to watch
whoever passed by .
At that time, a hunter and his dog
were returning home.
He saw the baby monkey lying on
the side of the path .

##
The hunter carried the baby
monkey to his home.
When the hunter reached home, his
three boys were excited to meet a
new friend, started playing with the
monkey baby jumping up and down
and fed it.

##
The three boys sang:
“Baby monkey
you will not fall down
we love you baby monkey x2
The monkey was thrown up and the
boys couldn't allow it to fall down at
all.

##
As the three boys played with the
baby monkey, mother Monkey was
watching them.
She was scared that her baby would
fall down and break as the boys
were throwing it up .

##
The kind woman came and saw
young boys playing with the baby
monkey.
She said politely to them, “Be
careful! Bring it here. You will break
it!”

##
She took the baby monkey in her
arms, and blessed it in Jesus' name.

##
When the woman put the baby
monkey down, mother Monkey
came running with a lot of joy.
She held her baby to her chest and
she disappeared up the tree.
