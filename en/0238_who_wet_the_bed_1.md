# Who wet the bed?

##
The night has come again and it
is dark.

##
After meals I go to bed with my
young sister Anna.

##
I am always scared because
every night I wet the bed.

##
Whenever I dream, I suddenly
wake up wet.

##
I quickly change position and
sleep in Anna's which is dry and
warm.

##
In the morning, I wake up first
and leave Anna in bed.

##
And when mother asks who wet
the bed, I loudly say it is Anna.

##
So the next day mother decides
to sleep with Anna in her bed.

##
Unfortunately, the same thing
happens and now there is no
one to else to blame.

##
Finally mother finds out that
Anna does not wet the bed but I
do.
