# Hen tricks Eagle

##
Long ago Hen and Eagle were
friends. One day, Eagle found
Hen under a tree resting with
her shopping bags. Hen was
standing on one leg.

##
Eagle asked Hen, “Where is
your other leg?”

##
Hen told Eagle, “The
shopkeeper cut off my leg and
gave me these groceries in
return.”

##
Eagle asked Hen whether
he could do the same.
He also wanted a bag
of groceries. Hen agreed.

##
Eagle went to the shopkeeper
and asked her to cut off one
of his legs in exchange for
groceries. The shopkeeper
accepted.

##
The eagle hopped on one leg
all the way home. But he was
happy with the things
the shopkeeper gave him.

##
When Eagle reached home,
he found Hen with both
her legs.

##
Eagle was furious and chased
Hen. But he never caught her.
Instead, Eagle always looks out
for Hen's children. Whenever he
catches one, he eats it.
