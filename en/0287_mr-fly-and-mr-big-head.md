# Mr Fly and Mr Big Head

##
This is Mr Fly.

##
This is Mr Big Head.

##
Mr Big Head and Mr Fly
were friends.
One day, they went for
a walk together.

##
They came to the edge
of a river, and started
arguing with each
other.

Mr Fly said, "You can't
jump over this river!"
"Yes, I can! It's you who
can't!" replied Mr Big
Head.

##
"You jump!" said Mr Fly.
"No, you jump first,"
said Mr Big Head.
So Mr Fly flew across
the river.

##
Then Mr Big Head
jumped into the river.
But his head was so big
that he started to sink.

##
Mr Fly laughed, "Hee
hee!"
But he laughed so
much that his mouth
tore in two from one
side to the other!
