# Crocodile in my body

##
Hello, I'm Ntombi. I'm a little girl
like other little girls, exceptâ€¦
I have a crocodile in my body.
You can't see him, but I know he is
there. His name is Horrible InVader.
He hides in my body and doesn't do
any harm to my friends.

##
He won't leave my body and go into
yours if you sit next to me, or hold
my hand.

##
He won't leave my body and jump
into yours even if you share your
lunch with me, or lie down on the
floor together when we have a rest.

##
My crocodile, Horrible InVader, has
been with me since I was born. He
likes eating all the soldiers in my
body that fight germs and stop me
from getting sick.
When he eats too many of my
soldiers, I get very sick. Then I
cannot go to school and play with
my friends.

##
I have to take my medicine every
day at the same time. Otherwise
my crocodile wakes up in a bad
mood and eats my soldiers again. I
don't want him to do that, so I
remind my Gogo to give me my
special medicine right on time.

##
If I eat good food like vegetables
and fruit, my soldiers in my body
get stronger and don't let my
crocodile catch them. I think he
goes to sleep for a while, because
then I am well and strong and able
to play with my friends again. I am
so happy when he goes to sleep
and I am able to play.

##
My Gogo took me to the clinic a
while ago and got something
special to feed my crocodile. It
makes him go to sleep, and he
doesn't eat my soldiers. Then I am
able to do all the fun things that
other children do, like run and climb
and dance.

##
I love my Gogo very much. She is
good and kind to me. She gives me
good food to eat and sees that I
take extra vitamins as well to keep
my soldiers strong, so that I don't
get sick. If I do get sick she takes
me to the clinic straight away, so
that I can get medicine to make me
better.
I love it when she puts me on her
lap and reads stories to me before I
go to bed.

##
After Gogo has put me to bed, I
think of many things. I think about
learning to read at big school. If I
keep taking my special medicine
that puts my crocodile to sleep, I
will look after my Gogo and read
her stories when she is very old and
can't see so well anymore.
When I am a grown woman, I would
like to study. I want to help to find a
medicine that will put all the
crocodiles in other peoples' bodies,
to sleep forever.

##
I will learn to live with my crocodile
and keep him asleep as much as I
can.
I will have as many friends as I can.
And have as much fun as I can
every day

##
My Gogo, my aunts and uncles, and
friends love me, even though I have
a crocodile called Horrible InVader
living in my body.
