# What will I use to travel?

##
There are many ways to
travel. Which will I
choose?

##
Should I use a plane?

##
Planes fly very high. I
am afraid of flying!

##
Perhaps I should use a
helcopter?

##
But helicopters and
planes are the same!

##
Should I perhaps use a
train?

##
But the train station is
very far.

##
Or, perhaps, I should
use a bus?

##
Our village has only one
bus!

##
Perhaps I will use a lorry
to travel.

##
But lorries are used for
carrying heavy luggage.

##
Should I use a bicycle to
travel?

##
But will my father give
me his bicycle?

##
Perhaps I will try to use
a boat?

##
But I do not trust boats
very much!

##
Aah! I know how I will
travel! I will use a
tractor.
