# Market cows

##
Everybody knew that Mama Schola
liked to shout a lot.

##
That day, it was about cows at the
market.
"Push these silly cows away," she
said. "They are eating my
vegetables."

##
"Hey you there! Push these silly
cows away from here," she insisted.
"They are eating my clothes."

##
"Where is the owner of these silly
cows?" she shouted. "They are
eating my grains."

##
Sorimpan, the herd boy, had just
gone to drink water at a tap when
his cows wandered off to the
market.
He hid away, squatting in fear,
when he heard the shouting
woman.

##
"Now look what these silly cows
have done!" she continued to
shout. "They have broken my
beautiful pots."

##
A short time later, "Aah! Not again!"
she was heard saying. "I will report
this matter to the police. These silly
cows have knocked down my fruit
stand."

##
Sorimpan finally came out stick in
hand, dodged between the
gathering crowds and managed to
get a clear view of his cows.
Sorimpan's cows knew him well so
they turned and looked up at him as
he appeared!

##
At this point, the big crowd of
onlookers of men, women and even
children all stared at the cows
which paid attention only to
Sorimpan.

##
Suddenly, the cows broke their
silence!
They began to talk all at the same
time, criticising the people!

##
The crowds were shocked and stepped back one by
one, afraid of the cows.
Then the cows stopped talking and watched the
crowd in amazement!
But Mama Schola was heard saying, "Since when did
cows meddle in our market businesses?"

##
It was Mama Schola's turn to be
criticised by the cows!
All the other women selling moved
to stand with Mama Schola out of
fear.

##
The cows criticised the women,
commenting on the state of their
vegetables, saying,
"What kind of vegetables are these?
They are all old and drying up!"

##
It was clear that the cows were not
yet done!
They turned round and faced the
cloth-stand and shouted, "You say
we eat your clothes, what clothes?
You mean these old rugs! Who will
buy them?"

##
The cows then moved to the next
stand and everybody followed them
with their eyes.
"Your grains are full of weevils. Who
wants to eat that! We only tasted to
see if this is a place to come more
often!" the cows sneered.

##
"And you Mama Schola," the cows
continued, "stop making noise. You
talk of these cracked pots?" The
cows turned their heads towards
Mama Schola's pots.
"They are no good, they break so
easily, so don't blame us."
With that, the cows turned and left,
followed closely by Sorimpan.
