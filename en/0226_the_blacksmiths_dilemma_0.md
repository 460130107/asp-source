# The blacksmith's dilemma

##
Once upon a time in a mountainous
African village there lived a famous
blacksmith.
The villagers called him Ratshipi the man of iron and steel.

##
Ratshipi was known by everyone in
the village.
They went to his shop every
morning to watch him work.
He seemed to be able to make
anything with his iron and steel.

##
Kgosi Mogale, the village chief,
heard about Ratshipi's work.
He sent his servants to bring
Ratshipi to the palace.

##
Ratshipi was happy to hear that
Kgosi Mogale wanted to see him.
“I will be very happy to work for the
chief,” he said.

##
So Ratshipi went to the palace.
“Ratshipi, I have heard about your
good work,” said Kgosi Mogale.
“I want you to do a very special
task.”

##
“With your iron and steel, I want
you to build a man who can walk,
cry real tears and bleed real human
blood.”
“Impossible!” thought Ratshipi. But
no one could say no to the king in
this village.

##
Ratshipi could not sleep that night.
How was he going to do this
impossible task?
He was very scared and very
worried.

##
Suddenly Ratshipi remembered a
wise old man Rapule. Perhaps he
could help.
But where was Rapule? He had
disappeared from the village.
People said that it was because he
had displeased the chief.

##
The next morning Ratshipi did not
go to his shop.
He went up the mountains to think.
While walking there, he saw an old
man sitting under a tree.

##
It was old Rapule!
“I am so pleased to see you,” said
Ratshipi.
“I have a big problem.”
He told Old Rapule the whole story.
Old Rapule thought carefully, and
then he said…

##
“Tell the chief that you will need a
thousand buckets full of tears and a
thousand African pots full of hair.
With the water, you will make
blood. With the hair, you will make
a fire to strengthen the steel man.”
“Thank you, thank you!” Ratshipi
said, running back to the palace.

##
Ratshipi said, “Kgosi Mogale, to do
what you ask, I will need two things.
A thousand buckets full of tears;
and a thousand African pots filled
with hair from the heads of the
villagers.”
Kgosi Mogale agreed. He asked his
headmen to tell the villagers.

##
Cries were heard from every corner
of the village. Young and old people
cried day and night to fill a
thousand buckets with tears.
Every villager's head was shaved
off and thrown into the pots.
But the tears and hair of all the
villagers were not enough to fill the
buckets and pots.

##
Eventually Kgosi Mogale gave up
and called Ratshipi back to the
palace.
“Ratshipi, you are a wise man, the
wisest in the village,” said Kgosi
Mogale. “Will you do me the honour
of being my chief headman?”
Ratshipi smiled.

##
“Only if you let old Rapule come
back to the village,” he replied.
So Ratshipi became chief headman.
And he and old Rapule were the
advisors of Kgosi Mogale.
