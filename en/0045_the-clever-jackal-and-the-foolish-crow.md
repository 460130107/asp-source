# The clever jackal and the foolish crow

##
Once upon a time Jackal was
walking around the bush. He was
very hungry. He saw the crow flying
above the trees. Crow had a huge
piece of cheese in his mouth.

##
"Hmmm...that cheese looks
delicious! I must find a way to get
it," thought the jackal.
"Oh, I have a plan!" said Jackal to
himself while wiping his mouth
quickly. He did not want Crow to
notice that he was hungry.

##
Crow had been flying the whole
morning. He was tired. He decided
to sit on a branch of a tree. The
jackal sat down under the tree
where Crow was sitting.

##
Jackal called with a huge smile,
"Hello Crow! You're looking very
good today. Your feathers look
glossy and healthy. You must be
taking very good care of yourself."

##
Crow was very flattered to hear this.
Crow always thought he was the
strongest and most beautiful of all
the other birds.

##
"I hear you also have the most
beautiful singing voice of all the
other birds. Won't you sing a song
for me this morning?"

##
Crow was so flattered that he
stretched his wings and prepared to
sing for the jackal. He pushed his
chest out and let out a loud pitched
sound.

##
As Crow started singing the cheese
fell to the ground, right in front of
Jackal. Crow stopped and looked
down. Jackal grabbed the piece of
cheese and ate it. He ran into the
bush and crow was left angry and
hungry.
