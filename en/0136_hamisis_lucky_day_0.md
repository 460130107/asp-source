# Hamisi's lucky day

##
Hamisi needs a new
school uniform. His dad
takes him to the
market.

##
Hamisi sees a boy
wearing a beautiful
shirt. "That is a very
fine shirt," thinks
Hamisi.

##
"I wish I had a shirt like
that boy," says Hamisi.

##
"Look, she is selling
those special shirts,"
says Hamisi. "Dad,
please buy one for me,"
he asks.

##
"Hamisi, I have to buy
your uniform," says
dad.

##
"I do not have enough
money for that shirt,"
says dad.

##
Hamisi's dad pays for
the uniform. He is
surprised when he gets
the change. There is
enough money left over
to buy a shirt!

##
It is Hamisi's lucky day!
Which shirt will he
choose?
