# The rat

##
Once upon a time,
there lived two rats.
One rat lived in the
bush.

##
The other rat lived in a
house.

##
One day, the rat that
lived in the house said
to the rat that lived in
the bush, “You eat
badly, sleep badly, and
it rains on you.”

##
“But us, we sleep in
chief's houses. We eat
many different kinds of
food. One day come
and visit me and see,”
said the house rat.
“I will come this very
night,” said the bush
rat. “I'm ready like a
straw for taking soda.”

##
Meanwhile the owner of
the house was furious.
He cursed, “These rats
that eat my food, they
will see!” This time, he
set a trap with sugar.

##
The rats came in to eat the
goodies in the house. They came
laughing,
“Chu...chu...chi...chi...che...che!”

##
When they reached the
trap the house rat said,
“Let me taste this
sugar. You see the
goodies we eat here.”

##
But before the rat could
take the sugar, the trap
snapped, PA! The trap
caught the rat's head,
and his eyes bulged like
eggplants.

##
The bush rat just
looked, amazed. He
said, “E...heee! My
friend, which goodies
did you eat that made
your eyes bulge?”

##
But the house rat could not reply.

##
The bush rat left the
house saying,
“Haa! I will not manage
these goodies you
praise.”

##
Your worst home is
better than your
neighbour's best home.
