# The frog and the lizard

##
The frog and the lizard were once
good friends .

##
They used to live at the beach
which was the frog's compound.

##
The frog lived in water but could
always come out to the beach.

##
The lizard lived on one of the tall
dry trees near the beach.

##
One day, the lizard requested the
frog to pay a visit to him at his
home on the tree.

##
‘'I cannot climb a tree'' a frog
explained to his friend,” I will help
you to climb” answered the lizard.

##
They then agreed to a certain date,
the one frog could pay the visit.

##
The day came and the lizard tied a
rope onto the frog's tail.

##
He started pulling the frog upwards
the tree .the frog cried out “am
feeling a lot of pain, the lizard
however, continued pulling the
rope upwards the frog's tail got
removed and the Frog fell down.

##
The frog lost his tail to date the
frog does not have its tail.
