# The Honeyguide's revenge

##
This is the story of Togar, the Honeyguide, and a greedy young
man named Gartee.
One day while Gartee was out hunting he heard the call of Togar.
Gartee's mouth began to water at the thought of honey. He
stopped and listened carefully, searching until he saw the bird in
the branches above his head.
"Chitik-chitik-chitik," the little bird rattled, as he flew to the next
tree, and the next.
"Chitik, chitik, chitik," he called, stopping from time to time to be
sure that Gartee followed.

##
After half an hour, they reached a
huge wild fig tree.
Togar hopped about madly among
the branches. He then settled on
one branch and cocked his head at
Gartee as if to say, "Here it is!
Come now! What is taking you so
long?"
Gartee couldn't see any bees from
under the tree, but he trusted Togar.

##
So Gartee put down his hunting
spear under the tree, gathered
some dry twigs and made a small
fire.
When the fire was burning well, he
put a long dry stick into the heart of
the fire. This wood was especially
known to make lots of smoke while
it burned.
He began climbing, holding the cool
end of the smoking stick in his
teeth.

##
Soon he could hear the loud
buzzing of the busy bees. They
were coming in and out of a hollow
in the tree trunk – their hive.
When Gartee reached the hive he
pushed the smoking end of the stick
into the hollow.
The bees came rushing out, angry
and mean. They flew away because
they didn't like the smoke – but not
before they had given Gartee some
painful stings!

##
When the bees were out, Gartee
pushed his hands into the nest. He
took out handfuls of the heavy
comb, dripping with rich honey and
full of fat, white grubs.
He put the comb carefully in the
pouch he carried on his shoulder,
and started to climb down the tree.

##
Togar eagerly watched everything
that Gartee was doing. He was
waiting for him to leave a fat piece
of honeycomb as a thank-you
offering to the Honeyguide.
Togar flittered from branch to
branch, closer and closer to the
ground. Finally Gartee reached the
bottom of the tree.
Togar perched on a rock near the
boy and waited for his reward.

##
But, Gartee put out the fire, picked up his spear and started
walking home, ignoring the bird.
Togar called out angrily, "VIC-torr! VIC-torrr!"
Gartee stopped, stared at the little bird and laughed aloud. "You
want some honey, do you, my friend? Ha! But I did all the work,
and got all the stings. Why should I share any of this lovely honey
with you?" Then he walked off.
Togar was furious! This was no way to treat him! But he would get
his revenge.

##
One day several weeks later Gartee again heard the honey call of
the Honeyguide, Togar. He remembered the delicious honey, and
eagerly followed the bird once again.
After leading Gartee along the edge of the forest, Togar stopped to
rest in a great umbrella thorn. "Ahh," thought Gartee.
"The hive must be in this tree." He quickly made his small fire and
began to climb, the smoking branch in his teeth. Togar sat and
watched.

##
Gartee climbed, wondering why he didn't hear the usual buzzing.
"Perhaps the hive is deep in the tree," he thought to himself.
He pulled himself up another branch. But instead of the hive, he
was staring into the face of a leopard!
Leopard was very angry at having her sleep so rudely interrupted.
She narrowed her eyes, opened her mouth to reveal her very large
and very sharp teeth.

##
Before Leopard could take a swipe at Gartee, he rushed down the
tree.
In his hurry he missed a branch, and landed with a heavy thud on
the ground twisting his ankle. He hobbled off as fast as he could.
Luckily for him, Leopard was still too sleepy to chase him.
Togar, the Honeyguide, had his revenge.
And Gartee learned his lesson.

##
And so, when the children of Gartee
hear the story of Togar they have
respect for the little bird.
Whenever they harvest honey, they
make sure to leave the biggest part
of the comb for Honeyguide!
